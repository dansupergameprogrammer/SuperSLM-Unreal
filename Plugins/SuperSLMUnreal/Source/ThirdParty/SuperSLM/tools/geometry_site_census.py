"""geometry_site_census.py -- T-2432 (design Sec2.5): the structural closure for the
class of geometry-assumption defects four independent passes (grounding, temper, audit,
fold round 1) each found more instances of. Converts "was every site found" from a reading
question into a checkable one, in three parts:

  1. Registry <-> marker symmetry. Every registry entry with status "fixed" or
     "confirmed-correct" has exactly its own `expected_marker_count` occurrences of
     `SSLM-GEOMETRY-SITE: GS-NN` in the tree (T-2441, Poirot 327ee29-t2438-ask5-tracka-
     review.md, Significant 4, D-SLM5438: the registry's own per-site count, not a blanket
     "at least one" -- several sites legitimately touch more than one code location, so
     the count itself varies by site); every marker in the tree has a matching registry
     entry. A site moved, deleted, or renamed without updating the registry fails here; a
     marker copy-pasted with the wrong id, or landed on the wrong declaration among a
     site's own several, fails here.
  2. Pattern <-> marker coverage -- the check that catches a site nobody has registered
     yet. An independent, deliberately broad regex family per assumption family, run
     across every source class the four grounding passes ranged over (*.cpp, *.h, *.hlsl,
     *.py), and every raw hit not covered by a marker within the same line window fails
     the census.

     WIDENED T-2509 (Claude/Linnaeus/t2508-geometry-interchangeability-fact-sheet-2026-09-01.md
     §3.1, dated 2026-09-01): the limitation named below as a prediction is demonstrated --
     `AdapterInChannelsFor`'s o_proj branch (include/superslm/adapter_marshal.h) has its
     condition (`proj == "o_proj"`) and its `return hidden_size;` on different physical lines,
     inside this census's own swept prefix (`include/`), and the single-physical-line form of
     Part 2 below did not catch it. Part 2 now ALSO runs a sliding multi-line window
     (`_WINDOW_SIZE` physical lines, joining every non-comment line in the window before testing
     the SAME `_r1_multiply_hit`/`_qow_hit` functions against the joined text) alongside the
     original single-physical-line test, so a co-occurrence split across up to `_WINDOW_SIZE`
     physical lines is now caught. This was validated BEFORE either §3.1 or §3.2 was fixed
     (StandardsDocument.md §4's own rule against validating a new check on a population its own
     fix would destroy): with the widening landed and adapter_marshal.h still UNFIXED, the
     census reported exactly one new "UNMARKED QOW PATTERN HIT (window)" finding --
     `AdapterInChannelsFor`'s o_proj branch, reproducing §3.1 -- and continued to correctly
     EXCLUDE `AdapterOutChannelsFor`'s already-known, already-excused q_proj residual (§3.2,
     same-line, already reachable by the pre-widening single-line check, unaffected by this
     addition), with `matched_exclusions` unchanged for it. See this ticket's own build log
     (Claude/Brunel/) for the pre-fix, widening-only run's full output. Overlapping window starts
     that both land on the SAME underlying defect are merged into one reported finding (below) so
     one real site is not reported once per line it spans.

     PRE-EXISTING LIMITATION (T-2468 F2, Claude/Mendeleev/t2468-census-recommissioning-
     2026-08-31.md Sec4a case 4, dated 2026-08-31): `_r1_multiply_hit`/`_qow_hit` themselves still
     co-occurrence-match on TEXT, never on tokens -- widening the window closes the "different
     physical line" gap, not the family's own reach (D-SLM5811's own ruling, "a census is an
     inventory control, not a completeness oracle," applies here exactly as it applies to the
     registry itself): a co-occurrence spelled out via a renamed local, an intermediate quantity
     computed several lines further upstream than `_WINDOW_SIZE` allows, or a derivation in a data
     file this scan's token list does not anticipate, still evades Part 2 entirely. A `PASS` from
     this census does not cover those shapes.

     DEAD EXCLUSION check (T-2475, Claude/Poirot/6597903-t2472-ask5-tracka-confirmation.md
     Observation, D-SLM5617): every `_PART2_EXCLUDED_TEXT` entry must match at least one
     non-comment line in its own registered file somewhere during the walk. An entry that
     matches nothing -- its excused statement deleted, moved, or reworded -- previously
     produced no diagnostic at all, indistinguishable from a healthy tree; it now fails the
     census by name (`DEAD EXCLUSION: ...`) so a stale, silently-inert exclusion is surfaced
     rather than left to describe a residual that no longer exists.
  3. Per-site regression check (T-2441, Poirot 327ee29-t2438-ask5-tracka-review.md,
     Significant 2, D-SLM5436; scope bounding corrected T-2445, Poirot
     ddbc57a-t2443-ask5-tracka-confirmation.md, Significant 2, D-SLM5436 superseded; keying
     corrected T-2475; keying corrected again T-2481 -- occurrence identification is now
     CONTENT-ADDRESSED rather than position-keyed, see below).
     Parts 1 and 2 both read whether a marker EXISTS; neither reads what the code AT a
     marked location actually says, so a "fixed" site whose own fix is reverted in place,
     marker left untouched, satisfies both. For every `fixed` site that carries a
     `required_tokens` list (the registry's own field, one substring set per site), at
     least one of those tokens must appear in that OCCURRENCE's own bounded scope -- the
     registry's own `required_token_scopes` map, keyed by FILE and matched to a specific
     physical marker by CONTENT (an `anchor` fragment expected near that occurrence's own
     code) rather than by that occurrence's position among its site's own other occurrences
     (see the registry's own header comment for how each record is derived). A revert that
     restores the pre-fix code removes the token the landed fix itself introduced, so this
     part fails where parts 1 and 2 do not. Demonstrated by construction: GS-14's fix
     reverted to `plan.out_channels = hidden_size;`, marker untouched, passes parts 1 and 2
     and fails here.

     T-2445 correction: scope used to run from a marker to the NEXT marker anywhere in the
     same file, which (a) swept unrelated code between two distant, unrelated sites'
     markers into the search -- a required token appearing there by coincidence masked a
     revert of the actual site -- and (b) for a multi-line site, let an untouched sibling
     line elsewhere in that same wide scope mask a revert of the one line a specific
     mutation touched. Executed and found doing exactly that: three independent single-line
     reverts (GS-12's o_proj in-width, GS-10's packed q_weight byte extent, GS-18's
     LayerScratch q_codes width) all passed under the old rule. The registry's own
     per-occurrence scope-end field closed both, at the time, by keying each occurrence to
     its marker's absolute line and storing the absolute end line: the bounded scope was
     exactly as wide as that occurrence's own governed code.

     T-2475 correction (Claude/Poirot/6597903-t2472-ask5-tracka-confirmation.md, Significant
     1): that absolute keying carried its own drift. The LOOKUP half (`marker_line`) is
     recomputed from a fresh scan every run, which a prior round read as making the whole
     structure self-correcting; the STORED half (the registry's own key and its end line)
     is a literal frozen at authoring time and is not recomputed by anything. An edit
     anywhere ELSE in the same file -- one comment line inserted far above every marker, not
     touching any site's own code -- shifts every marker below it without shifting the
     registry to match, and the census reports a false `MISSING ... ENTRY` on untouched,
     correctly-fixed code. GS-01's own registry note already records this exact shape being
     hit and hand-repaired once (T-2450's 8-line insert); the review reproduced it as the
     general case on demand. The registry now keys each occurrence by ORDINAL (this site's
     Nth marker found in this file, which an edit elsewhere cannot reorder) and stores an
     OFFSET from the marker to its own scope end (a local distance, invariant outside that
     occurrence's own span) rather than an absolute line -- removing the term that drifted
     rather than adding a rule to remember it. An edit INSIDE one occurrence's own governed
     span (between its marker and its own required token) can still desync the offset; this
     is unchanged from the prior scheme and is not the class either scheme targets.

Scope (T-2432): this census covers families R1 and QOW, the two families Track A owns.
Family KLP (the Option-G fused-K-landing assumption, GS-05) is Track B's own scope
(D-SLM5243) and is not built by this ticket -- GS-05 is registered with status
"not-yet-built" and is exempt from all three parts of this census until Track B's own
build lands it; running the KLP pattern sweep here would either find nothing (the code
does not exist yet) or, if Track B's own code already exists unmarked elsewhere,
incorrectly attribute Track B's own obligation to this census. Track B's own build is
expected to extend this same registry/script when it lands GS-05, not to duplicate the
mechanism.

Usage: python geometry_site_census.py [--repo-root PATH]
Exit 0 on a clean census (every fixed/confirmed-correct site has exactly its own registered
`expected_marker_count` of markers, no unmarked pattern hit exists for R1/QOW, and no fixed
site's own required token is missing from its marker's scope); exit 1 and a printed report
otherwise.

    D-SLM5670): the exclusion's own uniqueness bound -- "each fragment verified unique among its
    file's own non-comment lines" -- is a hand-checked, present-tense fact about today's tree, not
    a property the mechanism enforces on its own; a genuinely new, unregistered site written as a
    literal copy of an excused fragment is excised for free by a set-membership check exactly as
    readily as the real excused statement is, so uniqueness holding is not uniqueness enforced. A
    count in place of a set-or-boolean check turns that hand-verified assumption into something
    the walk itself confirms every run, on the same data it already visits -- run_census's own
    caller reports both a dead entry and an ambiguous one as findings rather than leaving either

    # --- Part 3: per-site regression check (T-2441, S2 fix, D-SLM5436). ---
    # Part 1 proves a marker exists somewhere in the tree; Part 2 proves no UNMARKED pattern
    # hit exists. Neither reads what the code AT a marked location actually says -- a "fixed"
    # site whose own fix is reverted in place, with its marker left untouched, satisfies both:
    # the marker is still there (Part 1), and the reverted line is within its own marker's
    # exemption window (Part 2). Demonstrated by construction (Poirot 327ee29-t2438-ask5-
    # tracka-review.md Significant 2): GS-14's fix reverted to `plan.out_channels =
    # hidden_size;`, marker untouched, both parts PASS.
    #
    # This part closes that gap for every `fixed` site that carries a `required_tokens` list
    # (registry's own field, one substring set per site, derived once from that site's own
    # diff against v1.3.0): for each marker OCCURRENCE (a site can have more than one, per
    # Part 1's own "several registered sites legitimately touch more than one call site"), a
    # bounded scope is derived and at least one of the site's own required tokens must appear
    # somewhere in it. A revert that keeps the marker but restores the pre-fix code removes the
    # token that scope would have contained (every landed fix introduces its own named quantity
    # -- effective_q_width, g_q_width, QWIDTH, or similar -- exactly because that is what
    # distinguishes the fix from what it replaced), so the site fails here instead of passing
    # silently. `confirmed-correct` sites carry no `required_tokens` (their own governing
    # quantity is correctly UNCHANGED by this ask, so a presence check would be backwards for
    # them) and are not checked by this part.

    # T-2481 (Claude/Mendeleev/t2480-census-recommissioning-2026-08-31.md F1, D-SLM5647/5659):
    # every STORED-COORDINATE keying this scope has ever used has been defeated by an edit its
    # own author did not imagine -- (path, line) by a new site written AT the excluded line
    # (T-2462); (path, text) substring by a statement appended to an excused line (T-2468,
    # that was Part 2's own class); occurrence-ORDINAL plus offset-from-marker (T-2475) by
    # REORDERING two of a multi-occurrence site's own existing occurrences in their shared file
    # -- nothing added or removed, marker count unchanged, Part 1 blind to it -- which desyncs
    # the ordinal-to-offset lookup from the occurrence it was meant to bound: the relocated
    # occurrence borrows a NEIGHBOR's own offset, which can spill past its own governed code
    # into unrelated downstream context that coincidentally satisfies the required-token check,
    # silently absorbing a genuine revert while citing an untouched line (demonstrated on GS-10;
    # reproduced here on GS-11, which the prior commissioning's own exposure list omitted --
    # see the registry's own header comment and this ticket's fix log). A fourth ORDINAL-shaped
    # keying was ruled out in advance (D-SLM5659): the defect is not which position is stored,
    # it is that ANY position (a proxy for where an occurrence's own code sits) drifts from that
    # code the moment the file's own layout changes around it, independent of the code's own
    # correctness.
    #
    # The replacement is CONTENT-ADDRESSED rather than position-keyed: `required_token_scopes`
    # (registry, below) maps each file to a LIST of scope records, `{"anchor": <str-or-null>,
    # "offset": <int-or-null>}`. A record's `anchor`, when not null, is an exact, literal
    # substring of that occurrence's own local code -- chosen, by hand, to be present whether
    # the occurrence's own fix is intact or reverted (never itself one of the site's own
    # `required_tokens`, so a revert cannot make the anchor disappear along with the thing it
    # is supposed to help detect) -- expected to appear somewhere within THAT record's own
    # claimed window, `[marker_line, marker_line + offset]`. For each physical marker occurrence
    # found in a file (order irrelevant), every one of that gs_id's own registered records is
    # tested against that marker's own local text; a record whose anchor is null applies only
    # when this gs_id has exactly ONE physical occurrence in this file (nothing to disambiguate
    # against -- ordinal is a degenerate, always-unambiguous identifier for a population of one,
    # which is why it is kept, unchanged, for the 17 of 20 `fixed`-with-`required_tokens` sites
    # that are single-occurrence-per-file; see the registry's own header comment for the
    # boundary this draws). Reordering two occurrences moves each one's own code -- anchor
    # included -- as one physical unit, so content-based lookup finds the SAME occurrence's own
    # correct offset regardless of which one now comes first in the file: there is no position
    # left in the key for a reorder to desync. Two registered anchors may legitimately match the
    # SAME set of candidates when two occurrences share literally identical local code AND an
    # identical offset (GS-12's two `ctx_wide` declarations); that is harmless by construction --
    # misassigning between them changes nothing, since both records agree on what to check. A
    # marker matching zero registered anchors, or matching anchors that disagree on offset, is
    # reported by name rather than silently guessed at (`MISSING SCOPE ANCHOR` /
    # `AMBIGUOUS SCOPE ANCHOR`, below) -- the same fail-closed posture Part 2's own dead/
    # ambiguous-exclusion checks hold.

    # census-fixes-confirmation.md Sec8 M1, D-SLM5759): GS-12's own nine occurrences are anchored
    # on their own explanatory COMMENT text, not a code prefix (see the registry's own header
    # comment for why -- a code-prefix anchor collided with unrelated, unmarked code once a
    # reorder moved it). That puts comment prose into the match key for ALL NINE of GS-12's
    # occurrences, through eight registered records (two occurrences, `occ2`/`occ7`, share one
    # record -- their local comment text is identical by construction, see the registry's own
    # header comment), so a developer who rewords one of those comments -- no code touched --
    # reddens this census with MISSING SCOPE ANCHOR, the exact diagnostic a genuine revert
    # produces.
    # Executed: changing "the normed" to "the normalised" in one GS-12 comment, no code touched,
