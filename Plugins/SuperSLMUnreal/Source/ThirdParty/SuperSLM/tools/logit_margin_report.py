"""Logit-margin measurement (T-1681): separates two explanations for a
token-choice divergence between the int8 engine and the float reference.

WHAT THIS COMPARISON ESTABLISHES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH. READ THIS BEFORE
ACTING ON ITS OUTPUT.

`tools/compare_float.ps1` (T-1679) already reports WHERE the int8 engine's
generated-token stream first diverges from the float reference's. It cannot
say WHY: divergence at the argmax is consistent with two different
explanations that look identical from the outside --

  1. Expected quantization behaviour -- float's top two candidates at that
     position are nearly tied, and int8 rounding noise flips which one wins
     the argmax. Not a defect.
  2. A real defect in the int8 forward path -- float strongly prefers its
     token and the int8 engine picks a different one anyway, which is not
     explained by noise near a tie.

This tool separates them by comparing the FULL logit distribution at each
generated position, not just the argmax:

  - float's top-1/top-2 margin at that position (float's own confidence,
    unnormalised, in float's own logit units -- this needs no cross-engine
    normalisation because it never leaves the float side).
  - the margin between float's top-1 and float's logit for the token the
    int8 engine actually chose (0 when the two engines agree). This is the
    number that answers the headline question, and it is reported both in
    float's own raw units (always valid) and z-scored against the float
    row's own dispersion (comparable across positions and prompts of
    different absolute logit scale -- see NORMALISATION below).
  - the RANK of the int8 engine's chosen token within float's own ordering
    (rank 1 = float's own top pick; rank 900 is far down the list).
  - whole-distribution agreement: Spearman rank correlation between the
    float logit row and the int8 raw logit row (full vocabulary, and
    separately restricted to float's own top-N, which is the more sensitive
    "does the head of the distribution track" reading), plus the maximum
    absolute z-scored difference between the two rows over that same top-N.

NORMALISATION -- STATED EXPLICITLY, PER STANDARD.
The int8 engine's `out_logit_rows` are raw int64-accumulated dot products
between int8-coded hidden-state codes and an int8-coded head weight matrix,
narrowed to int32 (forward_sites.h's LogitsSite comment: "wide row's bound is
hidden_size * 127 * 127"). The float reference's logits are float32 dot
products against float32 weights. These two are NOT on a common scale and
are NEVER compared as raw magnitudes anywhere in this tool -- an int8 value
of "500" and a float value of "0.8" carry no shared unit, and subtracting one
from the other would manufacture a number with no meaning.

What IS shared is that within ONE row, both engines' logits are (to first
order) an affine image of the same underlying real-valued pre-softmax score
for that position: softmax is shift-invariant and its ARGMAX and full
ORDERING are invariant to any positive rescaling of a row. That is what
licenses two specific comparisons, and only these two:

  1. Rank / ordering comparisons (argmax, top-k rank, Spearman correlation)
     -- valid under ANY positive monotonic transform of either row
     independently, which is the weakest assumption this tool can get away
     with and still say anything.
  2. Z-scored margins: each row is independently standardised, (x - row
     mean) / row standard deviation, computed over the FULL vocabulary of
     that row before any top-k selection. A margin expressed in
     row-standard-deviations is a scale-free measure of "how many units of
     this row's OWN spread separate these two logits" and is comparable
     across rows, prompts, and (with the stated caveat below) across the two
     engines, PROVIDED the two engines' rows have comparable shape after
     standardisation -- which is exactly what the Spearman/rank checks in
     this same report test for. If the whole-distribution agreement figures
     show the two rows are decorrelated, the z-scored margin comparison
     between engines is not trustworthy either, and this tool's own report
     says so rather than presenting the number anyway.

No other normalisation (min-max scaling to [0,1], softmax-then-compare,
temperature fitting, or any other rescaling) is used, because none of them
is justified by anything this tool has verified about the relationship
between the two engines' raw logit scales -- inventing one would manufacture
either a false alarm or a false all-clear, which is worse than reporting
nothing. If the measurements below do not support a normalised comparison,
this tool says so rather than presenting one.

THE CONTROL SET. A "wide" or "narrow" margin has no meaning on its own --
it needs something to be wide or narrow RELATIVE TO. This tool always runs
a mix of prompts where the two engines are known (or expected, subject to
this same measurement) to AGREE alongside the prompts under investigation,
and reports the z-scored-margin distribution for the agreeing positions as
the control this engine's own "healthy" profile is measured against.

USAGE
-----
    python tools\\logit_margin_report.py --max-new 8 --out-dir out\\t1681

Runs the built-in prompt set (see PROMPT_SET below), dumps both engines'
per-step logit rows to <out-dir>, and prints the margin table plus the cell
every number was measured over. Every number is EXECUTED here (D-SLM671):
this script does not accept precomputed inputs and reasons about them; it
drives both engines itself.
