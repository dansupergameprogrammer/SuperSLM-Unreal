"""T-2213 (D-SLM3783): the B3 pooled-report notice's real print sites, exercised through the real
CLI subprocess chain -- not a monkeypatched `build_runtime_additive_sections`, not a source-text
occurrence count.

`test_sslm_convert_adapter_b3_diagnostic.py`'s own `test_status_notice_is_printed_at_every_
pooled_report_output_site` is a static wiring check (it counts source references to the notice
constant); this file exercises the notice's real print sites end to end, against a real, on-disk
base checkpoint (`tools/_calibrate_checkpoint_fixture.py`) calibrated and converted via the real
`calibrate_checkpoint.py` and `convert_model.py` CLIs, then a real, on-disk BF16 PEFT LoRA
adapter (`tools/_t2194_bf16_lora_fixture.py`, already used by `test_sslm_convert_adapter_bf16.py`)
converted via the real `sslm_convert_adapter.py` CLI -- every step a genuine subprocess
(`sys.executable <script>.py ...`), no mocks, no monkeypatching.

T-2213 retired the B3 pooled ACCEPT/REJECT gate (`Claude/Loki/t2205/t2207/t2209/t2210/t2211`,
`Claude/Vitruvius/t2204`'s own fold round 4, Wizard repo; Dan's ruling D-SLM3783): nothing B3
computes can refuse to write an artifact any more, so every seed this fixture can produce now
reaches `main()`'s ACCEPT branch on B3 grounds (a domain trip remains the only structural
refusal, and this fixture's own fixed small geometry never trips it). `seed=0` (this fixture
module's own default) is used below; the retired suite's own `seed=7` (previously pinned as a
REJECT-branch cell, `Claude/Poirot/4299d84-t2206-b3-round2-confirmation.md` M2) is confirmed
below to now reach the ACCEPT branch too, closing the loop on the retirement rather than leaving
a stale reject-path cell in this file.

# the first non-tripping pair. Neither this suite nor the one before this fix round ever set
# `checkpoint_path` at all -- this is the cell that closes that gap, calling
