"""t2029_b3_execute.py -- B3's own first real execution (T-2021/T-2029, design Sec11 B3,
`Claude/Vitruvius/t1977-...-design-2026-08-13.md` Sec6 item 1/1a).

Runs the baked-adapter comparator (design Sec6 item 1, D-SLM3019/3085/3086) for the FIRST time
against a REAL PEFT LoRA adapter -- the shopkeeper adapter D-SLM2845 names
(`D:\\hf_cache\\superslm_artifacts\\qwen2.5-1.5b-shopkeeper-lora-v1\\final\\`), read directly
from its own `adapter_config.json`/`adapter_model.safetensors`, against the real base checkpoint
(`D:\\hf_cache\\hub\\models--Qwen--Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct\\...\\model.safetensors`). This is the
adapter's own bootstrap conversion (design Sec6 item 1: "the first adapter converted through this
pipeline serves as its own reference at bootstrap, since no other reference yet exists at B3's
first execution") -- it calibrates the four `Delta`s from its own PILOT partition and grades
itself on its own VALIDATION partition against the now-frozen `Delta`s, exactly as every future
adapter will be graded.

Scope of this first execution (stated explicitly, not left implicit): ONE representative
(layer, projection) pair -- layer 0, q_proj (in=out=1536, r=16, matching the real adapter's own
`adapter_config.json`: r=16, alpha=32, target_modules includes q_proj) -- not all seven
projections across all 28 layers. This is the minimal real, non-synthetic slice that proves the
comparator machinery end to end against real trained weights; extending to every adapted
(layer, projection) pair is a follow-on execution, not a change to the machinery itself. The
CALIBRATION CORPUS is synthetic (Gaussian-drawn per-token activations, matching this project's
own established convention for a representative RMSNorm-output distribution -- the SAME
convention `tests/t2018-slora-serial/t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s own `BuildAdapter`/`RunToken` use)
-- no real-text calibration corpus exists yet in this repository (SuperSLM_Plan.md Sec11's own
open obligation); this is named as an explicit, honest scope limit of this first execution, not
hidden.
