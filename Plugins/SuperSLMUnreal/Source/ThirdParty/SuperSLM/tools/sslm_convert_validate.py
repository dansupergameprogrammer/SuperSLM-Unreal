"""sslm_convert_validate.py — the converter's validate phase (S-HARDEN-3, F13).

`convert_model.py`'s writer previously coerced every array it emitted
(`np.asarray(..., dtype=np.int8)` and friends) with no prior range check: an
`int16 [128,-129]` calibrated array silently became `int8 [-128,127]`, and a
`float [1.9,-1.9]` array silently became `int8 [1,-1]` -- both NumPy 2.5.1
confirmed defects (SuperSLM_IndependentReview_Evaluation-2026-07-21.md F13).
Coercion is not proof: this is SS11's reject-over-degrade law running
backwards, since the converter is the ONE place that still has the
calibration pipeline's real values before they are narrowed into the
runtime's fixed integer widths.

`validate_model(model)` is a two-phase gate run BEFORE `build_sections`
touches a single array: every check below either passes cleanly or raises
`ConverterValidationError` with a stable `.code` (so a red test can assert
WHICH check fired, not merely that conversion failed -- the S-HARDEN-2
review's own lesson: "a rejection test must assert WHICH rejection fired ...
or a shadowing check makes it a vacuous witness"). Nothing here repairs,
clamps, or rounds a value into range; every violation is a hard rejection.

`model` is any object exposing the same attribute contract `build_sections`
(convert_model.py) already reads: `.config` (hidden_size, num_hidden_layers,
num_attention_heads, num_key_value_heads, head_dim, intermediate_size,
vocab_size, context_cap, tie_word_embeddings), `.weights` (name -> array),
`.dynamic_biases` (site -> (q_b, codes)), `.rope_tables` (cos, sin),
`.weight_scales` (name -> per-channel float scales), `.scales.scale(key)`
(per-head float scale lookup), `.composition_constants` (name -> (m, e)),
`.kv_landing_scales` / `.kv_landing_reciprocals` (name -> tuple). A hand-built
`types.SimpleNamespace` satisfying this contract is exactly what the test
suite constructs -- validate_model never imports the cross-tree spike, so it
is testable on a bare checkout with no calibrated checkpoint (the same
constraint that keeps tools/gen_iexp_domain_fixtures.py in the CI
`generators` job while gen_intmath_fixtures.py/gen_matmul_fixtures.py, which
DO import the spike, are not: .github/workflows/tests.yml's own comment).
