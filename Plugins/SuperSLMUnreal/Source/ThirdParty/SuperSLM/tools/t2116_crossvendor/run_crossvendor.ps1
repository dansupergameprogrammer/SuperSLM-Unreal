# T-2116 -- SuperSLM 1.0 GPU core cross-vendor certification.
#
# ASCII-only (no em-dashes, no smart quotes, no unicode anywhere in this file). A prior
# package (G-1, Claude/Laplace/gpu-determinism) shipped a script with an em-dash that
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 mis-decoded, producing a false FAIL (D-SLM2858). This script is
# plain 7-bit ASCII throughout and is run-tested under BOTH powershell.exe 5.1 and pwsh 7
# before it ships.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES. Runs the same battery of determinism, slice-invariance, and throughput
# tools this project already used to certify the GPU core on its own reference card (an
# NVIDIA RTX 2080 SUPER), against every D3D12 hardware adapter present on THIS machine,
# and compares the determinism-relevant output against the pins recorded on the reference
# card (pins\pins.txt). Throughput (tok/s) is measured and reported, labeled by adapter
# and cell, but is never gated pass/fail -- it is expected to differ across vendors.
#
# NO BUILD STEP. Every .exe under bin\ is prebuilt. This script only runs them.
#
# USAGE.
#   powershell -File run_crossvendor.ps1
#     Enumerates every D3D12 hardware adapter on this machine (skips software/WARP
#     adapters), runs the full battery on each USABLE one, and requires ALL of them to
#     pass for a zero exit code. A hardware adapter that enumerates but FAILS device
#     creation (USABLE=0) is a certification FAILURE, not a silent drop -- see
#     -AcknowledgeUnusableAdapters below if that is expected (e.g. a known-dead iGPU).
#
#   powershell -File run_crossvendor.ps1 -OnlyAdapterNameLike "*Radeon*"
#     Restricts the run to adapters whose DXGI description matches the given wildcard
#     pattern (case-insensitive). Use this if the machine also enumerates an integrated
#     GPU you do not want to certify -- e.g. a machine with a 7900 XTX plus an iGPU: only
#     the discrete card needs to pass for this ticket's own certification claim. If the
#     excluded adapter is USABLE=0, it is simply not matched by the filter and never
#     enters either list -- no acknowledgement flag needed. This flag is the correct
#     tool for "certify only this card"; it is NOT a way to make a USABLE=0 match go
#     away -- an unusable adapter that DOES match this filter still fails loudly unless
#     -AcknowledgeUnusableAdapters is also given.
#
#   powershell -File run_crossvendor.ps1 -OnlyAdapterIndex 1
#     Restricts the run to one adapter by its raw DXGI enumeration index (see the
#     "adapter enumeration" section this script prints at the top of every run).
#
#   powershell -File run_crossvendor.ps1 -AcknowledgeUnusableAdapters
#     Downgrades a USABLE=0 hardware adapter (that survived the -Only* filters, or all
#     of them if no filter is given) from a certification FAILURE to an explicit,
#     printed SKIP. Use this only when you already know a specific card on this
#     machine is not being certified this trip. The skip is still named in the console
#     output and in SUMMARY.txt -- it is never silently absent.
#
# EXIT CODE. 0 only if: at least one adapter was actually certified, every certified
# adapter passed every hard-pinned check, and no unacknowledged USABLE=0 hardware
# adapter was dropped from the run. Any missing .exe, missing .sslm artifact, or
# missing pins file is a loud, immediate FAIL -- never a silently-skipped cell and
# never a certification of a stale or absent binary.

# turns "this card could not be certified" into "this card was never asked" -- a gate
# that reads CROSS-VENDOR GATE: PASS while the card that mattered was never run. So a
# USABLE=0 hardware adapter that survives the -Only* filters is a certification
# FAILURE by default (loud, and it flips the final exit code), never a silent drop.
