SuperSLM 1.0 GPU core -- cross-vendor certification package (T-2116)
======================================================================

SOURCE OF TRUTH. This file, run_crossvendor.ps1, and pins/pins.txt are committed at
tools/t2116_crossvendor/ in the SuperSLM repository (branch brunel/t2116-crossvendor) --
this is the canonical copy; the flash-drive/scratch package copies these three files
verbatim. bin/ (prebuilt .exe files, built from this same commit via build.bat) and
artifacts/ (the real .sslm model/adapter files) are NOT committed -- they are build
products and large binary artifacts respectively, assembled into the package alongside
these three files but reproducible from the commit named in pins/pins.txt.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A run-only package that certifies the SuperSLM 1.0 GPU core on a D3D12 GPU other than
the NVIDIA RTX 2080 SUPER this project develops on. It checks three things, per adapter:

  (a) GPU decode output is bit-identical to the CPU-oracle reference values recorded
      on the 2080 SUPER (determinism).
  (b) The GPU decode path produces the identical result no matter how the work is
      sliced across dispatch calls (slice-invariance).
  (c) Tokens/second, measured and reported per cell, labeled by adapter and surface --
      NOT gated pass/fail, since throughput is expected to differ across vendors.

NO BUILD STEP. Every .exe in bin\ is prebuilt (MSVC 2022, this project's own build.bat,
SuperSLM main @ ce3e47c plus the adapter-selection change this ticket added -- see
CHANGES.txt-equivalent notes in the build log this package's own commit message points
at). Nothing on the target machine needs Visual Studio, the Windows SDK, or dxc.exe.

WHAT TO DO
----------
1. Copy this whole folder to the target machine (a flash drive is fine -- everything
   here is self-contained; nothing is written outside this folder except the results\
   subfolder this script creates).
2. Open PowerShell (either Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7/pwsh -- both work) in
   this folder.
3. Run:
       powershell -File run_crossvendor.ps1
   or, from inside an already-open PowerShell/pwsh window:
       .\run_crossvendor.ps1

   By default this enumerates every D3D12 hardware adapter on the machine (skipping
   software/WARP adapters) and requires ALL of them to pass. If the machine also has an
   integrated GPU you do not want certified, restrict the run to the card you care
   about:
       .\run_crossvendor.ps1 -OnlyAdapterNameLike "*Radeon*"
       .\run_crossvendor.ps1 -OnlyAdapterIndex 1
   (The script prints every adapter it finds, with its index, at the very start of every
   run -- use that list to pick the right filter.)

EXPECTED DURATION
------------------
Roughly 8-10 minutes per adapter on hardware comparable to the reference card (an
NVIDIA RTX 2080 SUPER). The two batch/thread-safety cells (b7, b8) are the slowest,
each 1-3 minutes; every other cell is under a minute. A machine with more than one
adapter certified runs the whole battery once per adapter, serially -- never in
parallel (this is a GPU-resident workload; two cells racing for the same GPU would
invalidate both).

WHAT A PASS LOOKS LIKE
------------------------
The script prints one line per battery cell per adapter (PASS or FAIL, with the
measured value), then one verdict line per adapter ("ADAPTER [n] <name> : PASS" or
"FAIL"), then a final line:

    CROSS-VENDOR GATE: PASS -- every requested adapter matched the RTX 2080 SUPER
    reference pins on every determinism check.

and exits with code 0. A full, timestamped, plain-text record of the run (every check,
every value, every adapter's driver version) is written to
results\<timestamp>\SUMMARY.txt, with a further per-tool raw log under
results\<timestamp>\adapter_<n>_<name>\<tool>.log.

WHAT A FAIL LOOKS LIKE
------------------------
Any of the following produces "CROSS-VENDOR GATE: FAIL" and a non-zero exit code:
  - A missing .exe, missing .sslm artifact, or missing pins file (checked before
    anything runs -- this is a loud, immediate failure, never a silently-skipped cell).
  - A determinism or slice-invariance check count, failure count, or exit code that
    does not match the pinned value from the reference card (pins\pins.txt).
  - A CPU/GPU divergence on the C5 oracle cell (the argmax token or the
    bit-identical/DIVERGENCE verdict).
Look at the specific FAIL lines the script prints, then the matching
results\<timestamp>\adapter_<n>_<name>\<tool>.log for the full raw output of that cell
(every battery tool prints the exact line and file where a check failed).

Tokens/second is NEVER part of the pass/fail verdict -- it is measured and reported,
labeled by adapter, cell, and surface, purely for comparison across vendors.

SHELL COMPATIBILITY
---------------------
Since SuperSLM 1.7.1, the engine's "# adapter: NAME" identity label (the one thing S3
above reads) is printed on stderr, not stdout. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7 differ
in how a native process's stderr lines reach a `2>&1` capture: 5.1 wraps each stderr
line in an ErrorRecord, whose own rendered text repeats the line's content, which would
double-match the label's regex and falsely fail every cell on 5.1 alone (the same class
of shell-specific false FAIL D-SLM2858 already burned this package on, for a different
reason -- an em-dash, see run_crossvendor.ps1's own header). run_crossvendor.ps1's two
capture points (adapter enumeration, per-cell battery run) both stringify the pipeline
before parsing it for exactly this reason -- the identical fix at both sites, the same
capture mechanism. What is run-tested, under both `powershell.exe` (5.1) and `pwsh` (7):
the committed per-cell capture-point expression, directly against one rebuilt battery
binary (t2113_b1_context_smoke.exe) -- see this release's build log for the transcript.
This script itself, run_crossvendor.ps1, has not been separately run end to end under
5.1 against a full rebuilt package; the enumeration capture point has not been exercised
in isolation either, though it is the same fix. If you see a "no '# adapter:' label
printed" or "adapter label MISMATCH" failure that looks wrong, confirm your
run_crossvendor.ps1 copy has this fix (grep it for "ForEach-Object" near the capture
lines) before suspecting the adapter or its driver.

Every cell above ran clean (0 failures) on the RTX 2080 SUPER before this package was
assembled -- see pins\pins.txt for the exact pinned counts.

ADAPTER SELECTION -- WHY IT MATTERS
--------------------------------------
A machine with more than one D3D12 adapter (a discrete GPU plus an integrated one, or
two discrete GPUs) has no reliable "the right one" without being told. This project's
battery tools did not have a way to select an adapter before this ticket; the change is
one environment variable, SSLM_GPU_ADAPTER_INDEX, read once at device-init time
(src\gpu\d3d12_harness.h) -- when unset, behavior is byte-identical to before (picks
whichever adapter DXGI_GPU_PREFERENCE_HIGH_PERFORMANCE ranks first). run_crossvendor.ps1
sets this variable once per adapter it certifies, in the same raw index order a
dedicated enumeration tool (t2116_list_adapters.exe, bin\) reports, and labels every
result with the adapter it ran on. A requested index that does not exist, is a software
adapter, or fails device creation is a loud tool-level failure, never a silent fallback
to a different adapter.
