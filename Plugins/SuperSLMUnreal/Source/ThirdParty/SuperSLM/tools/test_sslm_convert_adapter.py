"""Curie's red suite for sslm_convert_adapter.py, ported to green (T-2021/T-2029, B0).

Each test below ports one of `tests/t2018-slora-serial/t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s eight B0 cells
(`Claude/Curie/t2018-slora-serial-red-suite-2026-08-13.md` Sec4, Wizard repo) to exercise this
module's own derivation directly, at the RATIO level rather than by reproducing
`t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s own `QuantizedBase`/`BuildAdapter` random-quantization fixture bit-for-
bit — each C++ cell's own claim is a property of `derive_amplifying_triple`/`gate_check`'s
arithmetic over a stated ratio (or a ratio derived from stated `T`/`beta`/`S`/`alpha` values), not
a property of the C++ suite's own PRNG stream, so a hand-constructed ratio establishes the
identical claim `t2018_offline_red.cpp` proves by random sampling. Every hand-computed numeric
witness (`rho=4.5`, `delta_raw=1,000,000`, the fracture cell's `26.0%`/`0.02413` figures) is cited
from the design document (`Claude/Vitruvius/t1977-...md` Sec4/Sec11 B0) or from
`t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s own comments, not re-derived independently.
