"""Persisted CI gate for T-2149's AVX-isolation claim (Claude/Vitruvius/
t2149-avx-kernel-design-2026-08-18.md §6.4, §10 dimension 7 item (d), D-SLM3510;
red-suite realization: Claude/Curie/t2158-t2149-avx-red-suite-2026-08-18.md).

The design's own claim: `DotRowAvx2`/`DotRowAvx512` (src/matmul.cpp) are the ONLY two
functions in the whole project that may compile with AVX2/AVX-512 instructions enabled,
via GCC/Clang's per-function `__attribute__((target("avx2")))` /
`__attribute__((target("avx512f,avx512bw")))` mechanism -- never via a translation-unit-
wide compiler flag (`-mavx2`, `-mavx512*` on GCC/Clang; `/arch:AVX2`, `/arch:AVX512*` on
MSVC/ClangCL). A TU-wide flag on the matmul target (or any target compiling
src/matmul.cpp) would let the compiler's own auto-vectorizer use AVX2/AVX-512
instructions ANYWHERE in that translation unit, silently reopening the SIGILL risk on
hardware without those instruction sets that the whole force-macro/dispatch story
(design §6) exists to prevent -- with nothing red to catch it, since the two
function-attributed sites would keep compiling fine either way.

**Required coverage widened, fold round 4 (D-SLM3570).** Code review (T-2170, Finding 4)
executed five mutations against the pre-remedy checker and found it caught two of five
real spellings (`target_compile_options` and its `COMPILE_LANGUAGE` generator-expression
form) and was structurally blind to the `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=`/`/DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=`
command-line channel three of this repo's own CI jobs already use
(`linux-x64-asan`, `linux-x64-tsan`, `branch-coverage`), and to `add_compile_options`
(directory-scoped -- the widest-blast-radius spelling, applying to every target in the
directory including every forced-tier library at once).

**Required coverage widened a second time, fold round 5 (D-SLM3583).** Confirmation
review (T-2171, Finding 1) built an independently-found six-mutation population and found
the fold-round-4 matrix caught only its own control mutation. Two coverage dimensions,
per StandardsDocument.md §4: a **flag-text axis** the fold-round-4 matrix never widened
-- `_AVX_FAMILY_FLAG_PATTERNS` matched only the four literal `-mavx2`/`-mavx512*`/
`/arch:AVX2`/`/arch:AVX512*` spellings and was blind to the entire `-march=`/`-mtune=`
family (`-march=native`, `-march=x86-64-v3`/`-v4`, and any named microarchitecture that
selects AVX2/AVX-512, e.g. `-march=skylake-avx512`) -- the first thing a person reaches
for when they want this file to go faster; a sixth CMake spelling,
`string(APPEND|PREPEND CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS ...)`; and a third channel, an `env:` block's
`CXXFLAGS`/`CFLAGS` entry in a workflow YAML file (TU-wide for every compiler invocation
started under that environment, same as the existing `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=` CLI channel).
And an **input-set axis** -- `main()` read a fixed, hand-maintained two-path list
(the workflow file, one `build.bat`) behind an `os.path.isfile` guard that printed `OK`
and skipped silently on a missing/renamed path, while 15 files in this repository carry
a direct compiler invocation naming `src/matmul.cpp` (`tools/build_verify.bat` among
them) and the checker opened exactly one. Both axes are closed: `_AVX_FAMILY_FLAG_PATTERNS`
is widened, the CMakeLists.txt scan gains the sixth spelling, the workflow scan gains the
`env:` channel, and the checker now derives its own scanned-file population at check time
by walking the whole tree for direct-compiler-invocation sites naming `src/matmul.cpp`
(`scan_repo`) rather than reading one hand-maintained path -- a
file this walk finds but cannot open is a **checker failure** (`CheckerFailure`, distinct
stderr tag), not a silent skip; the `os.path.isfile`-guarded silent-skip path this
replaces is removed for the workflow file too (it is now opened unconditionally via
`_read_required`, which raises `CheckerFailure` rather than skipping on a missing path).

Mutation-provable (Curie's own "pin the documented claim" discipline,
~/.claude/personas/Implement/Curie/Curie.md): the fold-round-5 required-coverage floor was
the confirmation review's own independently-built six-member population. Confirmation
review (T-2174) built a population independently a second time and found the fold-round-5
widening regressed on three of six mutations it had just closed and never closed two
standing gaps -- because that widening, like the one before it, was validated only against
its own author's mutations.

**Required coverage widened a third time, fold round 6 (D-SLM3601/D-SLM3602).** Per
StandardsDocument.md §4, this is the third consecutive instance of the same coverage
failure and is closed structurally, not with a fourth pattern list: the validation floor
is now `tools/ci/matmul_avx_isolation_population.json`, a committed population
(deduplicated across all three casebooks' own findings) plus a clean-tree control and a
checker-failure cell, exercised by `tests/ci/test_matmul_avx_isolation_population.py`. Any
future widening of this checker reproduces green against the *whole* committed population
before it is trusted -- never a fresh subset the widening's own author chose. The specific
mechanism repair this fold makes, read at source rather than inferred from the symptom
(design §20.4): the CLI (`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=`) and environment (`CXXFLAGS:`/`CFLAGS:`)
channels were scoped to the one `--workflow` file and are now applied, unmodified, to
every file the tree-wide walk opens -- the direct-invocation channel alone keeps its
`matmul.cpp`-substring gate, since that is the only channel for which the gate is a
correct precondition. The direct-invocation first-token match now recognizes an
`@`-prefixed batch invocation and a compiler invoked via a build-variable reference
(`$(CXX)`/`$(CC)`/`${CXX}`/`${CC}`/`%CXX%`/`%CC%`) as well as a literal basename. A new
batch/shell environment-assignment channel (`set CXXFLAGS=...`/`export CXXFLAGS=...`/a
leading `CXXFLAGS=... <command>` prefix-assignment) is applied tree-wide on the same
no-`matmul.cpp`-gate rule. A workflow `env:` value using YAML block-scalar syntax
(`|`/`>`) is a `CheckerFailure`, not a silent non-match. Every mutation in the committed
population must flip this script's exit code from 0 to 1; the unmutated real tree, and a
scratch tree missing its required workflow file, must resolve exactly as the population's
own `"green"`/`"checker-failure"` cells specify. Executed and recorded per remedy (build
log).

**Confirmation review found five gaps of the same species, fold round 7 (T-2177).** The
population self-test could not tell a genuine hit from a crashed channel (fixed: two
`capsys` assertions on the checker's own stderr tags); `ctest -R` reported success on an
empty selection (fixed: `--no-tests=error`) and the CMake test registration's own
`else()` branch degraded silently (fixed: `message(FATAL_ERROR)`); the shell environment
channel truncated at the first space (fixed: `(.*)$`, matching its batch sibling); and the
CMakeLists channel -- the widest-blast-radius spelling -- was still scoped to the one
`--cmakelists` path while the CLI and environment channels had already gone tree-wide.
That last gap is closed here the same way `--workflow`'s channels were closed at fold
round 6: `find_cmakelists_hits` now runs against every `CMakeLists.txt`/`*.cmake` file the
tree-wide walk opens, on the same no-`matmul.cpp`-gate rule as the CLI, environment, and
batch-environment channels; `--cmakelists` is a required-file existence check only, exactly
like `--workflow`.

**Confirmation review found four gaps, fold round 8 (T-2179).** The CMake channel read
`CMakeLists.txt`/`*.cmake` and not `*.cmake.in`, missing `cmake/superslmConfig.cmake.in` --
the one CMake-language file in this repository that reaches every downstream consumer's own
configure via `find_package(superslm)` (fixed: `.cmake.in` joins the scan on the same
terms, M25 in the committed population). The shell-environment channel's value capture was
widened at fold round 7 without revisiting which assignment forms it recognizes at all: two
ordinary spellings stayed unwatched -- `CXXFLAGS+=-mavx2` (the Make-style/shell append,
no bare `=`; this checker's own history is a Makefile-shaped miss, T-2174's M13) and
PowerShell's `$env:CXXFLAGS = "..."` (this repository ships `.bat` build scripts and runs a
`shell: pwsh` step in `tests.yml`, so this is the natural Windows spelling). Fixed:
`_SHELL_ENV_ASSIGN_RE` admits an optional `+` before `=` (M26), and a new
`_POWERSHELL_ENV_ASSIGN_RE` pattern joins the batch/shell-environment channel (M27).
