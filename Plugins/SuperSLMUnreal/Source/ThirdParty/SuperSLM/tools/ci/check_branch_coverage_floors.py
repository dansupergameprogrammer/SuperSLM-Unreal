"""S-HARDEN-8 (design Sec4.1, Sec4.3; F12): the per-file branch-coverage
floor gate. Reads `llvm-cov export --format=text`'s JSON (source-only --
`src/` and `include/superslm/`, per the plan's own "a source-only LLVM
coverage leg" framing) and fails if any file's measured branch-coverage
percentage drops below its pinned floor in
tools/ci/branch_coverage_floors.json.

Per-file floors, not one aggregate threshold (F12's own finding: "a single
aggregate line threshold hides exactly the parser gaps that matter" --
artifact.cpp and model.cpp were the two files a 97%/92%/75.7% aggregate
concealed real gaps inside). Floors are measured, never invented: a run of
this gate with `--record-floors-to <path>` records the actual per-file
percentages to a build artifact, never to the committed floors file itself
(fold round 6, D-SLM3603 -- the record step and the check step never share
a file); a human commits the recorded value(s) into
tools/ci/branch_coverage_floors.json deliberately, and every subsequent run
compares against that committed file.

Usage (T-2149 fold round 4, D-SLM3569: the branch-coverage CI job merges profiles
across the non-forced binary and the forced-tier binaries so each SIMD leaf reaches
its own coverage in its own forced binary -- see .github/workflows/tests.yml,
branch-coverage job, for the full multi-binary build/run/merge sequence):
    llvm-profdata merge -sparse *.profraw -o merged.profdata
    llvm-cov export --format=text -instr-profile=merged.profdata \\
        out/cov/superslm_tests -object out/cov/superslm_tests_sse2_forced ... \\
        -- src/*.cpp include/superslm/*.h > coverage.json
