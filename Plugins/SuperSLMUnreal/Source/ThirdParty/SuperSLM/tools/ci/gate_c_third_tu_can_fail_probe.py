"""T-2139 sixth confirmation review O1 (Claude/Poirot/5fbd04d-t2139-sixth-confirmation-review.md;
the fifth casebook's O1 asked for one of two closers -- a scripted mutate-compile-revert step, or
naming the residual on the record. This is the scripted closer.)

Gate C's THIRD TU (tools/t2139_gate_c_real_suite_side_check.cpp) is a MUST-ACCEPT construction --
it has no committed must-reject sibling, so HEAD carries no repeatable, re-runnable proof that it
can fail at all. The sixth casebook's reviewer hand-proved this twice already (once compiling a
mirrored governed append, once a one-sided append, both against scratch copies outside the repo)
and both times the reviewer had to rebuild the constructions by hand. This script commits that
proof as a repeatable battery step instead of leaving it to be re-derived by hand every round.

Mechanism: copy include/superslm/sslm_abi.h into a SCRATCH include tree under out/ (gitignored,
never touches the tracked file), append ONE new enumerator to the scratch copy's own
SSLM_STATUS_ENUM_LIST X-macro -- a ONE-SIDED append, since tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h is
left completely untouched -- then compile the real, unmodified
tools/t2139_gate_c_real_suite_side_check.cpp with the scratch include directory placed AHEAD of the
real one on the include path (/I<scratch>/include /Iinclude /Itests), so the compiler resolves
superslm/sslm_abi.h to the mutated scratch copy while every other header (including the real
tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h) resolves normally.

Required outcome: the compile FAILS, and the captured output names this construction's own
registry-top sentinel assertion (the "registry-top divergence" static_assert message,
tools/t2139_gate_c_real_suite_side_check.cpp:88-93) -- not merely any failure, the SAME
marker-text discrimination this round's S1/S3 fix requires of the CMake-side negatives. A clean
compile means the third TU's only can-it-fail evidence has regressed; a failure without the marker
means it failed for an unrelated reason. Either is reported as a hard failure. The scratch tree is
removed afterward regardless of outcome.

T-2142 (S3, Claude/Poirot/aea6116-t2139-seventh-confirmation-review.md): this script previously
REFUSED TO RUN unless `git status --porcelain` was already empty BEFORE it touched anything, and
build.bat treated that refusal as fatal to the whole 892-line battery -- one untracked scratch
file anywhere in the repo aborted every real-artifact tool, the unit suite, and every other
checker after it (line ~362 of 892), which is the state a builder is in whenever a builder is
mid-edit -- the ordinary "edit, build, see if it worked" workflow this repo's own build.bat exists
for. Executed: one untracked file at the repo root reproduced the abort exactly.

The stated justification did not hold up under its own claim ("this probe's own revert-and-verify
contract depends on knowing what state was clean"): the probe never writes to the TRACKED tree at
all -- the scratch header goes under out/t2139/gate_c_third_tu_mutation_probe/ and the compiled
artifacts under out/, both covered by .gitignore:2. Knowing what was clean never required that
EVERYTHING was. The fix replaces the precondition with the property the probe actually needs and
can honestly assert: a snapshot of `git status --porcelain` taken before this script does
anything, compared against the same command taken after cleanup -- fails only on a DIFFERENCE
(this script itself changed something in the tracked tree), never on pre-existing, unrelated
dirt. This is strictly stronger than the old "must start clean" gate (it also catches a leak the
old gate could not: this script dirtying the tree while some OTHER file was already dirty, which
the old precondition would have refused to even attempt) and it passes on an ordinary dirty
working tree, which is the whole point.
