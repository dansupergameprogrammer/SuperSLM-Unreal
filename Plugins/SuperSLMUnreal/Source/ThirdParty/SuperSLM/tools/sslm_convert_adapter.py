"""sslm_convert_adapter.py — B0: converter-side delta-fold derivation (T-2021/T-2029, design
`Claude/Vitruvius/t1977-v5-lora-composition-reconciliation-design-2026-08-13.md` Sec4/Sec11 B0,
Wizard repo).

Ports the arithmetic `tests/t2018-slora-serial/t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s B0 cells already prove
correct (`DeriveTripleNew`, `RealizedRatio`, the WIRING-AND-DERIVATION gate) into the real Python
converter target `SuperSLM_Plan.md` Sec11 names — "the converter's adapter mode." Offline, no
engine change (design Sec11 B0's own scope): this module derives the two new per-channel triples
a runtime-additive LoRA adapter's artifact section carries —

  - `delta_identity`/`delta_mult`/`delta_exponent`, one triple per adapted-projection output
    channel (design Sec9's `DeltaFoldScales` array), converting the delta's own raw-accumulator
    scale into the base's post-WSC1-fold currency;
  - `u_identity`/`u_mult`/`u_exponent`, one triple per rank index (design Sec9's `UFoldScales`
    array), converting the intermediate rank-`r` product into the engine's int8 activation-code
    domain before it feeds the second low-rank GEMM.

Both triples are consumed at runtime by `ApplyAmplifyingWeightScaleFold` (design Sec4, D-SLM2915),
a NEW engine primitive (B1a/B2's own build obligation) — this module derives the triples but does
not implement or call that primitive; it derives the SAME triple the primitive is proven to apply
correctly (`t2018_offline_red.cpp`'s own `DeriveTripleNew`/`ApplyAmplifyingWeightScaleFold` pair),
so B1a/B2's C++ implementation and this module's Python derivation are two independent
implementations of the same specification (design Sec4), not one re-derived from the other.

WIRING-AND-DERIVATION (design Sec11 B0, D-SLM2979/D-SLM3018/D-SLM3023): this module's own
`gate_check` reproduces the two-part acceptance gate the real converter runs on its own output
before emitting an artifact section — WIRING (branch-selection: the applied triple matches the one
independently re-derived from the same required ratio) and DERIVATION (ratio-self-consistency:
the applied triple's algebraically-decoded realized ratio agrees with `T*beta[i]/S`, recomputed
from the primary calibration artifacts, within the triple format's own constructive 2^-31
precision). Per the design's own final rescoping (D-SLM3018/D-SLM3023/D-SLM3025), this gate proves
branch-selection and ratio-self-consistency GIVEN the converter's own `T` — never composed-quality
sufficiency, which is B3's alone.

T-2046 (design §24, D-SLM3157-3172, T-2043 fold of D-SLM3154's routed blocker): this module now
ALSO writes artifact bytes. B0b landed the two on-disk section types (T-2021/T-2029); §24.2 pins
the full standalone adapter-artifact byte format around them (a new `Provenance`/`ADP1`
sub-format, `Weights`/`WGT1` for the adapter's own A/B, `DeltaFoldScales`/`UFoldScales` via the
pre-existing `write_tensor_manifest`) and §24.3 pins the `--fallback=merge` numerical procedure —
both specified for the first time by that fold, closing Poirot's `c81e48c` review Significant 6.
The writer/CLI additions live in this file's own bottom section, below `dispatch_conversion_outcome`.

# shared `scale` parameter, so `delta_norm` scales QUADRATICALLY in `scale` for the honest set,
# and the "corrupt" set is that same honest baseline with `b_scaled` further multiplied by a
# constant `k`): the 18 honest candidates' `ratio_to_ref` spans 0.0099x-100.0x (the earlier
# ~6.2-6.3x figure came from "honest scale=0.05" alone -- 3 of the 18 honest rows; the fuller
# 6-of-18 in-band slice examined at the time also included "scale=0.02", omitting the "scale=0.1"
# (~25x) and "scale=0.2" (~100x) rows the SAME probe run and file also report); the 8 corruption
# candidates' `ratio_to_ref` spans 0.1x-100000.0x, with two readings at EXACTLY 10.0x and one at
# 0.5x. Corroborated row-for-row at the shipped band by the SAME probe's
# `t2204r4_magnitude_domain_output_band0.1-10.json` sibling (`band` field `[0.1, 10.0]`, identical
# ratios for every one of the 26 labels). `Claude/Loki/t2210-probe/t2210_magnitude_axis_output.json`
# replays the SAME 26 labels and confirms the constructions correspond, but its own rows carry no
# `delta_norm`/`ratio_to_ref` field and cannot corroborate the axis this check gates. On the high
# side the honest population's own max (100.0x) sits TEN TIMES ABOVE the lowest corruption reading
# that side has (10.0x) -- not a gap, an inversion: some "corrupted" candidates read a smaller
# ratio than some honest ones. On the low side a corruption (0.5x) sits well inside the honest
# range (which itself reaches down to 0.0099x). No threshold, symmetric or one-sided, separates
# these two populations on this axis, because the "corruption" construction here (an honest
# baseline with `B` uniformly rescaled) and ordinary honest scale variation are the same
# transformation of the same underlying weights -- the metric cannot tell training-time magnitude
# choice apart from post-hoc rescaling, which is the same conclusion the whole B3 pooled-gate arc
# reached about raw magnitude generally (this ticket's own commission, above). D-SLM3787's own
# "25x honest max to 41.6x corruption floor" does not survive this recomputation: the 25x figure
# silently excluded the census's own ~100x rows, and 41.6x is
# `Claude/Loki/t2207-t2204-restrike-2026-08-20.md`'s composed-STATISTIC margin (D-SLM3750) --
# a different quantity, never measured on this ratio axis at all, repeating exactly the
# quantity-confusion `Claude/Poirot/8af620a-t2214-gate-retirement-confirmation.md` finding S2
# raised against the figure this comment previously shipped.
#
# 10.0x therefore ships as a plain, non-calibrated sanity distance -- present for visibility,
# never a discriminator, never a REJECT (see below). On the executed census it warns on 12 of the
# 18 honest candidates -- 6 rows at ratio > 10x ("scale=0.1", ~25x, and "scale=0.2", ~100x) and 6
# rows at ratio < 0.1x ("scale=0.002", ~0.01x, and "scale=0.005", ~0.06x); the check's own
# inclusive lower band catches the second six -- and stays silent on 3 of the 8 corruptions (the
# two at exactly 10.0x, inclusive compare, and the one at 0.5x). A caller who wires a real
# reference adapter should expect the warning to fire on honest conversions at either extreme of
# scale and should not read its absence as a health signal.

    Claude/Vitruvius/t2204's own fold round 4, Wizard repo) established its accept boundary was
    one frozen reference adapter's own idiosyncrasy, not a property of adapter health, and Dan's
    ruling (D-SLM3783) retired the arithmetic rather than continuing to repair it.

    What ships instead:

    - **`per_pair_diagnostics`** (`_b3_pair_diagnostic`, design §25.5 item 2, arithmetic itself
      unchanged) -- T-2213 fix round (D-SLM3787 finding S3): this function's own numbers ARE
      affected by the retirement even though the diagnostic's own arithmetic is not. The two
      `_bootstrap_se` calls this function used to make against the pooled population, before this
      per-pair loop, are deleted along with the retired verdict; they used to consume the shared
      `rng` first, so every pair's own bootstrap draws below shifted to a different point in the
      stream the moment those two calls were removed (executed on a constructed pair:
      `composed_tail` margin 2.4227 -> 2.4316). The loop now seeds its own `rng` at its own point
      of first use (below), so this cannot happen again from an unrelated change elsewhere in this
      function. Reports every pair's own bias-corrected margin against its OWN self-calibrated
      Delta, never gating, and is the primary B3 review signal this tool reports
      (`_B3_POOLED_GATE_STATUS_NOTICE`).
    - **`delta_norm`** (T-2213, new): the candidate's pooled composed LoRA delta norm --
      `sqrt(sum over pairs of delta_norm_sq)`, reusing `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`'s own
      already-computed `b_scaled @ a_f` product per pair, no fresh computation.
    - **`magnitude_warning`** (T-2213, new): `None` unless `reference_delta_norm` is supplied AND
      `delta_norm` sits outside `[reference_delta_norm / magnitude_warn_ratio,
      reference_delta_norm * magnitude_warn_ratio]` (derivation above `_B3_MAGNITUDE_WARN_RATIO`).
      When present it is a named finding with `disposition: "unresolved"` -- it NEVER sets
      anything an emission decision reads; `build_runtime_additive_sections`'s own
      `margin_exceeded` is unconditionally `False` now that this function computes no verdict.

    `pair_draws`: an ordered list of `(name, raw)` pairs, `raw` being `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`'s
    own return shape -- one entry per adapted (layer, projection) pair.

# =============================================================================================
# Design §26.15, AS CORRECTED (T-2099) -- the freeze-time conversion-health gate.
#
# WHAT THIS GATES. At freeze time a CANDIDATE adapter's conversion health is compared against a
# matched REFERENCE adapter's, per tier: Tier 1 over the pooled draw population, Tier 2 once per
# projection type present. The decided quantity is a RATIO -- `stat(candidate) / stat(reference)`
# for `stat` in {sample sd, p95} -- checked against a band, and the verdict is three-valued
# (D-SLM3288): UNRESOLVED first, else PASS if in band, else REFUSE. `freeze_allowed` is true only
# on an overall PASS.
#
# WHY THE ORIGINAL §26.15 REPAIR WAS ONE-SIDED, and what changed (the external review's finding,
# 2026-08-14; D-SLM3295). §26.15 derived resolving power as `band / relSE(stat(REFERENCE))` --
# the bootstrap relative SE of the reference population ALONE (`margin_of(ref_pooled, band)` in
# `Claude/Vitruvius/t2096-verdict-repair-probe/t2096_verdict_repair_probe.py`) -- and its
# escalation instruction re-collected the REFERENCE only, leaving the candidate at the production
# default `pilot_n=200`. Statistical power for a ratio depends on BOTH samples. Two consequences,
# and the second is the one that makes the gate unsafe rather than merely imprecise:
#
#   1. The margin is overstated. With equal-sized samples it is too large by a factor of about
#      sqrt(2); as the reference is escalated it grows without bound while the candidate's own
#      contribution to the ratio's uncertainty is untouched.
#   2. **Escalating the reference alone can drive ANY cell to RESOLVED.** As
#      `relSE(reference) -> 0`, the reported margin -> infinity, while `relSE(ratio)` floors at
#      `relSE(candidate)`, which never moved. The specified escalation procedure was therefore a
#      false-RESOLVED generator: spending collector time on the reference buys a RESOLVED verdict
#      on a ratio whose real uncertainty is unchanged.
#
# The corrected form below computes the ratio's own relative SE jointly,
# `relSE(R)^2 = relSE(stat(cand))^2 + relSE(stat(ref))^2` (first-order propagation for the ratio
# of two independent estimates -- the candidate and reference populations are collected from
# disjoint seed streams, `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`'s own `seed_base`/`validation_seed_base`
# construction), and escalates BOTH sides together at the same geometric step. That also makes the
# must-reject construction production-feasible for the first time: §26.15's own executed REFUSE
# re-collected the CORRUPTED CANDIDATE at the escalated count, which the specified production
# escalation never did, so the control exercised a data path production could not produce
# (`StandardsDocument.md` §5.4). Under joint escalation the candidate IS re-collected, so the
# construction and the production path are the same path.
#
# A SECOND ONE-SIDEDNESS, closed here rather than left for a later round to find: each tier gates
# on TWO statistics (sd and p95) and §26.15 derived resolving power from the p95 alone. A tier
# whose sd ratio is unresolvable cannot honestly PASS on the p95's resolving power, so the tier's
# achieved margin is the MINIMUM over the statistics that gate it. The p95-only figure is still

    real B3 raw-draw collection (`_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`) -- `saturation_elevated` is the
    named residual stated in this file's own §24 banner comment, never computed here.

    T-2213 (D-SLM3783): B3 no longer has a pooled accept/reject gate. `run_b3_pooled_report` is
    called ONCE after this loop, over every pair's own raw draws, and returns a REPORT (per-pair
    diagnostics, the candidate's own pooled `delta_norm`, and an optional `magnitude_warning`) --
    never a verdict. `margin_exceeded` (below) is therefore unconditionally `False`; nothing B3
    computes can refuse to write an artifact any more (design §25.3's original per-pair AND-gate,
    and design §25.5's pooled replacement, are both retired -- the AND-gate for being structurally
    broken independent of true adapter quality, the pooled replacement per T-2213's own retirement
    lineage above `run_b3_pooled_report`). `run_b3_bootstrap_check`'s own per-pair self-calibrated
    verdict survives only as `run_b3_pooled_report`'s own per-pair DIAGNOSTIC layer (flagged,
    never gating, §25.5 item 2) -- this tool's primary B3 review signal.

    `reference_delta_norm`: optional, passed through to `run_b3_pooled_report` unchanged -- when
    supplied, the candidate's pooled `delta_norm` is compared against it (see
    `_B3_MAGNITUDE_WARN_RATIO`'s own derivation comment for the threshold). `None` (the default)
    means no reference is configured for this conversion and the magnitude sanity check is
    reported but never fires -- this project's own real reference adapter's raw checkpoint no
    longer exists on disk (O1, `Claude/Poirot/6ac7b84-t2209-pooled-gate-confirmation.md`, Wizard
    repo), so no production-calibrated reference value is fabricated here; a caller with a real
    reference adapter available supplies its own delta norm.

    `sections` is `None` only when `domain_trip` fires somewhere (a `None` triple is not
    serializable at all -- structurally excluded, design §6 item 2). Every other pair is derivable
    and assembled: §7 distinguishes "cannot even represent the ratio" (structural, `domain_trip`)
    from "represents it" (nothing else gates whether a pair's own content can be assembled, now
    that B3's pooled quality gate is retired) -- whether the assembled artifact is actually
    WRITTEN to `--out` is `dispatch_conversion_outcome`'s own call (`main()`, below), never this
    function's; this function's only job is "can it be built," never "should it ship."

    Returns `(sections_or_None, verdict, round_trip)`. `verdict` feeds
    `dispatch_conversion_outcome` directly (`domain_trip`/`margin_exceeded`/`saturation_elevated`)
    and carries the pooled report's own full result (`verdict["pooled"]`, including
    `per_pair_diagnostics`, `delta_norm`, `magnitude_warning`) plus each pair's own domain-trip
    status. `round_trip` is this build's own record of what was derived and written, per
    `"layer{L}.{proj}"` key -- what the round-trip proof (T-2046 handoff) compares the REAL C++
    loader's own output against,
    bit-for-bit.

    `checkpoint_path` (T-2046, added after a real 196-pair sweep was killed mid-run by an
    external process-management event, not a crash -- 2026-08-14; format changed under T-2065 to
    persist each pair's own RAW draws rather than only its old per-pair `accepted` boolean, since
    the pooled gate needs the raw per-item populations, not per-pair summaries): if given, each
    pair's own raw draw arrays (the ~6.5s/pair cost; every other step -- reading tensors,
    quantizing, deriving triples -- is ~0.1s/pair and simply re-run) are appended as one JSON line
    per pair to this path as soon as computed, and on entry, any pair already recorded there has
    its SAVED raw draws reused instead of re-running `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`. A resumed run
    therefore re-pays only the cheap per-pair steps for already-checkpointed pairs.
