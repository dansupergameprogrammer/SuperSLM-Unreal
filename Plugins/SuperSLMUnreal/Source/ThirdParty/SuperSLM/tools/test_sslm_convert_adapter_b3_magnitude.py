"""T-2213 (D-SLM3783): Brunel's red-first suite for the B3 magnitude sanity check that replaces
the retired pooled ACCEPT/REJECT gate (`run_b3_pooled_report`, `tools/sslm_convert_adapter.py`).

Five adversary strikes (`Claude/Loki/t2205`, `t2207`, `t2209`, `t2210`, `t2211`,
`Claude/Vitruvius/t2204`'s own fold round 4, Wizard repo) established that the retired pooled
gate's accept boundary was one frozen reference adapter's own idiosyncrasy: honest in-domain
adapters rejected on magnitude alone (9 of 18 at >=2.5x the reference) and on pure structure alone
(20 of 60 at the reference's own magnitude), and no in-band corruption construction ever elevated
the statistic once magnitude was intercepted. Dan's ruling (D-SLM3783): delete the arithmetic, ship
the per-pair diagnostics (unchanged, tested elsewhere -- `test_sslm_convert_adapter_b3_diagnostic
.py`) plus a wide, non-blocking magnitude sanity WARNING.

This is the builder's own red-first suite, authored in the same context as the check it tests --
NOT the independent, blind-to-the-builder's-own-controls commissioning `StandardsDocument.md`
§5.4 requires before an instrument's verdicts are load-bearing. That independent pass is owed, not
claimed here (`Claude/Poirot/8af620a-t2214-gate-retirement-confirmation.md` finding S6): this
file's own must-accept sweep (Cell 2, 1.0x-6.0x) is entirely inside the shipped band and is
structurally unable to surface the honest candidates the arc's own executed census already
recorded above the band (~25x, ~100x -- see `_B3_MAGNITUDE_WARN_RATIO`'s own derivation comment),
which is exactly the blind spot the independence clause exists to catch. The check's readings are
not load-bearing (they never gate emission), which is what keeps this suite legitimate as a
mechanism check in the meantime.

Cells below pin the mechanism `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws`/`run_b3_pooled_report` actually
implement: the must-accept sweep confirms the check does not repeat the retired gate's own
false-REJECT (a candidate T-2210's own strike showed the OLD gate wrongly refusing), the must-fire
cells confirm a grossly rescaled candidate is at least flagged for visibility, and the boundary
cells (Cell 3b) pin the literal shipped constant with numeric literals rather than reading it back
from the module, so the suite cannot silently tolerate the constant drifting to a materially
different value. None of this establishes that the check discriminates honest from corrupted
adapters in general -- the derivation comment above `_B3_MAGNITUDE_WARN_RATIO` states plainly
that the full executed census shows it does not. Both constructions below are producible by the
real production data path: `_b3_collect_pair_raw_draws` is the real per-pair collector, called
here with hand-built `(a_f, b_scaled)` pairs exactly as
`Claude/Loki/t2210-probe/t2210_guard_probe.py`'s own `collect()` calls it, not a reimplementation.
