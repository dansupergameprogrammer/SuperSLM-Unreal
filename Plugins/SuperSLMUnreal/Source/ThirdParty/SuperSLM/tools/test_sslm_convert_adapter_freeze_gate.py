"""Standing cells for the corrected freeze-health gate (design Sec26.15 as corrected, T-2099).

These promote the T-2099 probe's own findings to permanent coverage, per D-SLM3297. The probe runs
the real collector and takes minutes; these run on synthetic arrays in under a second and pin the
DECISION RULE rather than any particular measured number -- so a future edit that reintroduces the
one-sided form, or that quietly turns the three-valued verdict back into a boolean, reddens here.

The finding these exist for (external review, 2026-08-14; D-SLM3295): Sec26.15 derived resolving
power from the REFERENCE sample alone and escalated the reference alone, which understates the
ratio's uncertainty always and can drive any cell to a false RESOLVED. `test_reference_only_
escalation_cannot_manufacture_resolution` is that finding, as a cell.
