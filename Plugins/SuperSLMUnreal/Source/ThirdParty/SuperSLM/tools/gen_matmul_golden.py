"""Emit tests/matmul_golden_pin.h — the S2.5 matmul cross-platform golden hash and the
canonical input set it is taken over (design SuperSLM_matmul_subslot_design-2026-07-20.md
§10 step 5 / §11 item 6).

The hash pinned by this script is computed here, in ARBITRARY-PRECISION PYTHON INTEGER
ARITHMETIC reproducing the design's §5 scalar reference — never by running the C++ kernel
and recording what it printed. The golden is therefore generated FROM the reference, the
same discipline gen_matmul_fixtures.py and gen_intmath_fixtures.py apply, and a C++ path
that agrees with it agrees with an independent computation rather than with itself.

WHY THE INPUTS ARE GENERATED, NOT PINNED AS DATA
The S2.4 golden pinned its input (the SIL1 sigmoid table) as a C++ literal, because that
input was a converter-emitted float64 table and regenerating it with libm at test time
would have made a cross-platform std::exp difference a FALSE determinism break. Matmul has
no such hazard: its inputs are int8 activation and weight codes, and the canonical set
includes a 132,105-element case whose vectors would be megabytes as literals. The inputs
are therefore produced by a PINNED 64-bit LCG — pure uint64 arithmetic, exactly defined by
the standard on every toolchain, calling nothing — mirrored bit-for-bit by the C++ test.
kMatmulGoldenLcgProbe pins the generator's own first bytes, so a generator drift fails as a
distinct, named check instead of masquerading as a kernel determinism break.

WHAT THE CANONICAL SET COVERS (design §11 item 4)
Both real hidden_size values (1536, 960) and both real intermediate_size values (8960,
2560) — all block-aligned at the common SIMD widths, so on their own they never exercise a
remainder — plus two deliberately non-block-aligned synthetic lengths (tails of 5 and 7),
the int8-extremes row at both operands' limits, the in_channels=1 architectural floor,
THREE 132,105-deep cases, and TWO 4,194,305-deep cases (added fold round 4, D-SLM3571;
depth corrected from an initial 524,289 -- see below).

The shared accumulator flush window (src/matmul.cpp's kFlushBlocks, a single literal
value) trips at a per-tier ELEMENT count that is NOT the same figure across tiers, because
each SIMD tier processes a different lane width per iteration: 131,072 elements on SSE2 (8
lanes), 262,144 on AVX2 (16 lanes), 524,288 on AVX-512 (32 lanes) -- corrected fold round
4 (D-SLM3572; code review T-2170, Finding 7 found the prior wording stated one shared
trip-point figure, which is true of the literal and false of the per-tier element count it
produces). The three 132,105-deep cases cross only the SSE2 window: deep_beyond_i32_neg
and deep_beyond_i32_pos (single-signed, sums outside int32) discriminate SSE2's flush
mechanism, but a flush-block deletion on AVX2 or AVX-512 at this depth is bit-identical to
the unmutated kernel (code review, Finding 5) -- 132,105 never reaches either window.
deep_flush_lcg_132105 escapes neither int32 nor either wider window: an LCG fill's mixed
signs cancel and its largest accumulator is 3,027,949, comfortably inside int32.

CROSSING A TIER'S FLUSH TRIP POINT IS NOT THE SAME AS FORCING GENUINE OVERFLOW WITHOUT IT.
The trip point is the depth at which the periodic flush code path executes at least once;
whether DELETING that flush changes the result depends on whether the per-lane int32
partial sum, left unflushed for the WHOLE call, actually escapes int32 -- and the flush
window (kFlushBlocks=16384 iterations) was deliberately chosen with a 4x safety margin
(536,870,912 against INT32_MAX's 2,147,483,647, src/matmul.cpp's own comment), so a depth
that crosses the trip point by one element leaves an unflushed partial sum still
comfortably inside int32. This first surfaced as a design-side claim (an initial fixture
at 524,289 -- one element past AVX-512's own 524,288 trip point -- was believed sufficient
to discriminate all three tiers "from a single case") and was found wrong by EXECUTION,
not by re-reasoning: a standalone harness linking the real kernel with each tier's
periodic-flush block deleted was run directly against 524,289 elements and matched the
oracle exactly on both SSE2 and AVX2 -- no discrimination at all. A depth sweep against
both mutant kernels found the true break points empirically: SSE2 first mismatches
between 524,289 and 1,048,576 elements; AVX2 first mismatches between 1,048,577 and
2,097,152. 4,194,305 -- one past 2^22, comfortably beyond both measured break points --
was then confirmed to mismatch on both tiers at that depth and deeper (3,000,000;
4,200,000; 5,000,000 all also mismatch). AVX-512's own break point was NOT executed (no
AVX-512 hardware on this build machine, standing per design §8.4); by the same doubling
pattern the two measured tiers show (each wider lane width roughly doubles the element
depth needed for the same ~65,536-iteration overflow threshold), 4,194,305 is expected,
not verified, to also exceed AVX-512's own break point -- flagged underived for that one
tier specifically, per StandardsDocument.md §5.4.

The two 4,194,305-deep cases (deep_beyond_all_windows_neg/_pos, single-signed) close the
SSE2/AVX2 mapping from a single case, verified; AVX-512's own mapping remains unverified
by execution, standing alongside its other §8.4 gaps.

That distinction is the whole point of this set and was got wrong once already. The first
version of this golden had a single LCG-filled deep case and claimed it carried sums outside
int32. It did not, every case fit int32, and a review proved that substituting a
wrapping-int32 accumulator reproduced the pinned hash bit-for-bit — the gate would have
passed a kernel that narrowed mid-reduction, on every platform. Reaching the int64 range
requires SINGLE-SIGNED products at the maximal attainable magnitude (±127 against -128), and
that is why design §8 names the length 132,105.

Do not trim the two single-signed cases. main() asserts, from the accumulators it actually
computes, that at least one case leaves int32; that guard fires if they go.

The hash covers, per case: every int64 accumulator GemmInt8Accumulate produces (the shipping
dispatch — SSE2, AVX2, or AVX-512 on x64 depending on the tier selected, the scalar
reference on arm64), the DotRowScalarRef value for row 0
(so the normative scalar construction is inside the golden even on x64, where the shipping
dispatch never selects it), and NarrowAccumulatorToI32's int32 output for the cases whose
declared MatmulAccumWidth is Int32 per §8's 131,071 bound.
