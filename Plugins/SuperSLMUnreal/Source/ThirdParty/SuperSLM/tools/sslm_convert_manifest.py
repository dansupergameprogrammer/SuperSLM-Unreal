"""sslm_convert_manifest.py — invoke the §13 item 7 independent C++ verifier
and merge its manifest with the calibration-side fields only Python can
supply (S-HARDEN-3, F13).

`tools/sslm_verify.cpp` (built as the `sslm_verify` CMake target) opens the
just-written `.sslm` through `SslmModel::Load` -- the same entry point every
runtime consumer uses -- and writes a JSON manifest built from what the
loader actually accepted: never from this module's own arrays. This module's
job is the glue: locate the compiled binary, run it, and merge its output
with what only the Python side ever had (the calibration input's source
hashes, and the converter's own git commit). `convert_model.py` calls
`verify_and_merge` once, after `sslm_format.write_artifact` returns.

Kept import-independent from convert_model.py's cross-tree spike import (see
sslm_convert_validate.py's module docstring for why), so it is testable on a
bare checkout against a fake verifier stand-in.
