"""T-1933 -- Arm D/E's red suite: T-1822 §31.4.4's 11-cell Coverage Model.

Design of record: `Claude/Vitruvius/t1822-activation-scale-remedy-design-2026-08-07.md`
§31.4.1 (the converter change), §31.4.2 (the five-arm matrix), §31.4.3 (the arithmetic
corpus), §31.4.4 (the 11-cell Coverage Model table this suite realizes) -- as corrected
by `Claude/Vitruvius/t1919-armd-correction-fusedq-fold-2026-08-11.md` (13-candidate
enumeration, Arm E, structural population disjointness). This suite realizes the model;
it does not amend it -- no cell here required the design to be re-interpreted (§6).

**At this suite's original authoring (T-1933), none of Arm D/E's own machinery existed on
this tree.** `pipeline.py`'s legacy converter (`_calibrate`/`_observe`/`_derive_scales`/
`_derive_composition_constants`) computed one K/V scale per LAYER (not per head) and wrote
it into both `kv_head` slots identically (`pipeline.py:1809-2082` -- see each cell below
for the exact lines; the standing pins below cells 1/2 confirm this legacy path is still
what Arms A/B exercise today). At authoring time there was no calibration-policy argument,
no candidate-scale sweep, no five-arm harness, no arithmetic-distinctness gate, and no
calibration-policy provenance marker anywhere in this file or elsewhere under
`Tools/superslm_spike/`; every cell below was therefore authored against symbols this
suite itself named as the contract the build had to satisfy (§0) -- red by an absent
symbol, an absent dataclass field, or, where the property was reachable through code that
already existed, a real assertion failure against the then-current, degenerate behavior.

**The build has since landed** (T-1934/T-1937/T-1938, `Claude/Poirot/7f99a81048-t1937-
t1938-confirmation.md`): every §0 symbol now exists on `reference_pipeline.pipeline`, and
every cell in this file runs green against the real, shipped implementation. Each cell's
own docstring below states what made it RED at authoring time; where a T-1936
confirmation-review finding showed a cell passing for the wrong reason, the re-authored
cell (cells 3-5, 7) states the mutation it discriminates now instead.

## §0 -- The contract this suite specifies (declared, not built)

New symbols on `reference_pipeline.pipeline`, named here so the build round has no interface
question left to resolve on its own initiative (T-1899's own declared-not-defined
convention, adapted to Python's red-unimplemented shape via `conftest.api`/`require`):

- `calibrate_kv_landing_arm(cfg, float_weight, records, tokenize, *, arm)` -- `arm` one of
  `"A","B","C","D","E"` (the design's own letters, T-1822 §31.4.2). Returns a `dict`:
  `"ordering"` (`"legacy"|"fused"`), `"granularity"` (`"per_layer"|"per_head"`),
  `"observation_domain"` (`"union"|"post_rope_only"|None`), `"kv_landing"`
  (`{f"{prefix}.k_head{h}": (m, e)}`), `"kv_reciprocals"`, `"softmax_khead"`
  (`{f"{prefix}.softmax_khead{h}": (m, e)}`), `"candidates"` (arms D/E only:
  `{f"{prefix}.k_head{h}": [{"offset_eighths_bit": k, "attention_score_error": float,
  "saturation_rate": float}, ...13 entries, k in {-8..-1,0,8,16,24,32}]}`),
  `"selected_offset"` (arms D/E only: `{f"{prefix}.k_head{h}": k}`). Realizes cells 1-5, 7.
- `classify_signed_ratio_resolution(candidate, reference, se, z_crit)` -- returns
  `"RESOLVED"|"NOT RESOLVED"|"UNDERPOWERED"` from the bare ratio alone (T-1890,
  D-SLM2324-2327), no `δ_min`-shaped term. Realizes cell 6.
- `CalibrationPopulationOverlap(ValueError)` and
  `check_calibration_eval_disjoint(calibration_ids, eval_ids)` -- raises on any collision.
  Realizes cell 8.
- `DuplicateArithmeticProblem(ValueError)` and
  `check_arithmetic_corpus_distinct(problems)` -- `problems` a list of
  `{"operation": str, "operand_tuple": tuple, ...}`; raises on a duplicate
  `(operation, operand_tuple)` key. Realizes cell 9.
- `grade_arithmetic_report(problems, model_answers, float_answers)` -- returns a list of
  `{"problem_id", "truth_correct": bool, "float_agreement": bool}`, the two columns
  computed independently (D-SLM2346). Realizes cell 10.
- `QuantizedModel` gains a new frozen-dataclass field,
  `kv_calibration_provenance: dict = dataclasses.field(default_factory=dict)`, alongside
  the existing `composition_constants`/`kv_landing_scales`/`dynamic_biases` fields
  (`pipeline.py:874-882`) -- `{"arm": str, "ordering": str, "observation_domain": str|None}`
  per layer/head or per model, distinguishing a per-head-calibrated build from a
  legacy-union one. `artifact_cache.save_artifact`/`load_artifact` gain the matching
  serialize/deserialize lines (`artifact_cache.py:328-341` write side,
  `artifact_cache.py:588-599` reconstruction side). Realizes cell 11.

Every new symbol lives in `reference_pipeline.pipeline` (the converter this design's own
§31.4.1 reads from, `D:\\Wizard\\Tools\\superslm_spike\\pipeline.py`), matching the
project's own citation of this file as Arm D/E's home.

# per-channel weight perturbations (8x-20x on one output channel of eight, every channel,
# every head) -- every winning (lowest-error) candidate's own saturation_rate ties
# max-abs's exactly; every candidate that clips MORE than max-abs has WORSE error and is
# never selected. RMSNorm bounds the per-token activation's own overall energy tightly
# enough, before requantization ever runs, that the "clip a little more to buy resolution
# elsewhere, and still come out ahead on error" trade-off row 5 exercises for an
# un-normalized activation does not reproduce here — a real, structural consequence of the
