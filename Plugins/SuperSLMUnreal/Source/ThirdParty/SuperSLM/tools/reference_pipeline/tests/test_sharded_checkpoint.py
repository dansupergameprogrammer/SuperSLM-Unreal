"""T-1912 — multi-shard safetensors checkpoint support: the red suite (T-1921).

Realizes `Claude/Vitruvius/t1912-sharded-checkpoint-support-design-2026-08-11.md` §7's
Coverage Model, as folded by T-1916 and T-1920 (design §11/§12) -- the design's most
recent state, not a transcription of an earlier draft. Authored red, before
`_open_checkpoint_tensors`, `_ShardedSafeTensors`, and `_require_safe_shard_filename` exist
in `reference_pipeline.pipeline`: every cell that targets one of those three symbols directly
fails via `conftest.api`'s `red-unimplemented` AssertionError, this suite's existing
precedent for a cell that cannot go red any other way (`conftest.py`'s own module
docstring). Cells that drive the new code through the existing `load_model` and
`artifact_cache.load_artifact` entry points instead fail today for those entry points' OWN
current reason -- `pipeline._checkpoint_tensor_file`'s pre-existing "N weight shards"
rejection, or `artifact_cache._reopen_or_stub_float_source`'s current message shape -- named
at each cell as `red-uncalibrated`.

Coverage Model dimension -> cell map (design §7; dimension 3, concurrency, is
not-applicable and carries no cell; dimension 5's construction-time-firing property is
discharged structurally by dimension 2's six mode cells, none of which ever calls
`.tensor()` -- see this file's dimension-5 note below rather than a duplicate cell):

    1  -> TestDimension1Lifetime
    2  -> TestDimension2TrustBoundaries (+ TestDimension2Mode0)
    4  -> TestDimension4ShapeAndPlatform
    5  -> note only, in TestDimension2TrustBoundaries's module docstring
    6  -> TestDimension6NumericalEdges
    7  -> TestDimension7ContractClaims
    8  -> TestDimension8Composition
    9  -> TestDimension9Persistence
    10 -> TestDimension10FunctionalAchievement
    11 -> discharged by TestDimension2TrustBoundaries's mode 1-5 cells (each is a single
         mutation off a known-valid baseline) -- see that class's docstring

Full cell-by-cell rationale: `Claude/Curie/t1921-shard-support-red-suite-2026-08-11.md`.

**T-1928 addendum (2026-08-11).** The T-1922 build landed this feature and every cell above
now passes. A confirmation pass (`Claude/Poirot/d5dd7ce507-shard-fix-confirmation.md`, C1)
then reverted each of three production fixes to its literal pre-fix text and found that NO
cell above -- in this file, the pre-existing regression tier, or the real-checkpoint
upstream tier -- moved. The three cells at the end of this file (`TestT1928MutationPins`)
close that gap: each is a mutation-verified tripwire for one specific, previously-invisible
regression, proven red against the reverted text and green against the fix, both directions
executed and reported. Test-design record: `Claude/Curie/t1928-shard-mutation-pins-2026-08-11.md`.

    projection's weight array non-vacuously populated -- shape matches
    `_upstream_names(cfg)`'s prediction, neither all-zero nor all-NaN (design §7 dimension
    10, F4) -- not merely that no exception was raised. This IS the "real-checkpoint
    calibration" run T-1909 stopped short of (design §2), so it is gated `upstream` and
    left to run at full cost when this suite is exercised with `-m upstream`.

    **Measured cost (D-SLM2591, 2026-08-11, superseding D-SLM2582's wrong 62-minute figure
    and D-SLM2584's "pending" state): ~213 minutes wall-clock (~3.6 hours)** for a full 3B

    ~11.5 GB peak resident, GPU idle end to end (D-SLM2591's own provenance: a blocking
    process wait from the dispatching context, sampled at 92/182.6/190 minutes before exit).
    Pytest's own internal session timer for that run reports `12437.10s` (`3:27:17`, 207.3
    minutes) for the 3-cell upstream session as a whole -- this cell is the overwhelming
    majority of that time; the other two `@pytest.mark.upstream` cells in this file are raw
    header-parse-plus-memmap reads costing seconds. The two readings (207.3 min pytest-
    internal, ~213 min external process wall-clock) differ by interpreter startup and import
    time outside pytest's own timer, not by disagreement about the work. This sits close to,
    without beating, T-1909's ~5.83-hour single-core projection for the same operation
    (D-SLM2550) -- unlike D-SLM2582's 62-minute figure, which measured a run that died early
    against a still-landing implementation and never reached this cell's own work at all

        what actually reproduces on THIS host, not the general claim: of the classic
        reserved device names, only `CON` and `NUL` resolve as devices here (`COM1`/`PRN`/
        `AUX`/`LPT1` do not), and of those two only `CON` hangs -- `NUL` returns EOF and
        raises a distinct, non-hanging error (casebook C5). Confirmed directly during
        authoring, outside pytest, under a bounded probe: `open("CON", "rb").read()` did
        not return inside a 10 s bound.

        **T-1931 round-2 confirmation, D6 (Observation, disposed rather than expanded into
        a new cell).** The hostile-device set on this host is wider than either this
        docstring or `pipeline.py`'s own enumeration names: `CONIN$` and `CONOUT$` (not
        members of the classic reserved-name family either docstring scopes to) also
        return `exists()=True`/`is_file()=False` here, and `CONIN$` also hangs on read
        (confirmed under an 8 s bounded subprocess probe during this round, same shape as
        `CON`). This is an enumeration-accuracy gap, not a coverage hole: `is_file()`
        rejects both by the same predicate `CON` exercises, not by name-matching a list, so
        the remedy already covers them and no additional cell is needed to close the gap --
        recording it here is the disposition.

        **T-1931 round-2 confirmation, D5 (Observation, disposed by an explicit skip).**
        This cell's discriminating power rests on `CON` resolving as a device on the host
        running it; where it does not, `exists()` and `is_file()` agree (both `False`) and
        BOTH the fixed and the reverted predicate raise `ConfigError` identically, so the
        cell would pass under a live regression rather than catch it -- a vacuous pass, not
        a swept one, but indistinguishable from either without saying so. The precondition
        is checked explicitly below and the cell skips, naming the reason, rather than
        passing silently when it cannot discriminate -- mirroring `symlinked_shard_farm`'s
        own skip-if-the-host-lacks-the-precondition convention elsewhere in this file. This
        keeps a "skip reads as swept" failure mode (`conftest.py`'s own module docstring)
        from applying here: what is skipped is not the check, it is the one host-shape this
        cell cannot exercise, and the skip message says exactly that.

        This is the ticket's own named hazard -- "one of these defects is a hang that
        consumes the machine with no diagnostic" -- so the construction runs in a SEPARATE
        PROCESS under an explicit timeout, not in-process. Today (fixed code) the
        subprocess returns in well under a second with a clean `ConfigError`. If this cell
        ever regresses, `subprocess.run`'s own timeout converts what would otherwise be an
        indefinite, undiagnosable wedge of the whole pytest run into a single bounded test
        FAILURE naming exactly what happened -- verified during authoring by reverting
        `is_file()` to `exists()` in a scratch copy and observing `TimeoutExpired` fire
        cleanly at the bound, with no orphaned process surviving it (test-design record).

        """Casebook §6.1 item 3 (T-1924 M1). A `model.safetensors.index.json` whose bytes
        are not valid UTF-8 must raise `ConfigError` naming the encoding failure -- never a
        raw `UnicodeDecodeError`.

        **Corrected by T-1931 (round-2 confirmation, D2): the prior text here was false.**
        `UnicodeDecodeError` IS a `ValueError` (`issubclass(UnicodeDecodeError, ValueError)
        is True`, executed) and so it IS caught by
        `artifact_cache._reopen_or_stub_float_source`'s degrade net
        (`except (OSError, ValueError):`, `artifact_cache.py:411`) -- it does not propagate
        out of `load_artifact`. The true reason this cell matters is stronger than the false
        one: a raw `UnicodeDecodeError` is **silently absorbed** into the generic degrade
        stub and the artifact loads with no live float source and no visible sign that
        anything is wrong until a caller happens to touch `float_weight` -- the exact
        degrade-over-reject outcome `_ShardedSafeTensors`'s own class docstring cites §11
        to forbid. Confirmed end to end during authoring, against a scratch copy carrying
        this exact mutation with a real `ModelConfig` and a checkpoint directory holding a
        non-UTF-8 index: `_load_index_json` raised the raw `UnicodeDecodeError`,
        `_reopen_or_stub_float_source` caught it and returned the stub (did not propagate),
        and the stub's own message folded in the causing exception's text.

        Mutation-verified during authoring (test-design record, both directions).
