"""T-1937 -- mutation pins for the three PRODUCTION remedies landed against
`Claude/Poirot/ecc820fd4f-armd-arme-converter-matrix.md` (T-1936's FIX-THEN-SHIP review
of the T-1934 Arm D/E converter build).

Design of record: `Claude/Vitruvius/t1822-activation-scale-remedy-design-2026-08-07.md`
§31.4.1-§31.4.4. Review of record: `Claude/Poirot/ecc820fd4f-armd-arme-converter-matrix.md`
findings 5.3 (Q-scale), 5.4 (refusal gates), 5.5 (NaN classification), D-SLM2624-2626.

This file pins the PRODUCTION-side findings only (T-1937's scope). The three test-author
findings (cells 3/4/5's vacuous sweep, cell 7's label-vs-behavior gap, the presence/absence
naming defect) are a separate, later round's scope and are not touched or pinned here.

Every pin below was verified red-then-green by execution during authoring, per the
same-round pin rule (`Claude/CLAUDE.md`): the reverse mutation was applied in-process,
the suite was run, the failure observed, and the mutation reverted. See
`Claude/Brunel/t1937-production-fix-round-2026-08-11.md` for the quoted executions.
