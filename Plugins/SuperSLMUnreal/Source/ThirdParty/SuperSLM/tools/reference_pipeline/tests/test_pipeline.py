"""Plan §15 — the simulated integer pipeline: a Qwen2.5-shaped decode over the proven primitives.

§15: "offline Python; simulated integer pipeline in torch — static scales, pinned requant
semantics, i-exp/i-sqrt constructions, RoPE tables — no runtime code needed". The
primitives (`intmath.py`, `rope.py`) are green and proven. This suite pins the forward
pass that wires them into a decode, so the spike measures the pipeline that ships rather
than a plausible neighbour of it.

Three problems this artifact has that the scalar primitives did not, and the cells that
pin them:

1. **Vectorization recreates §6.2's SIMD discipline.** A scalar Python pipeline over 600
   records x ~40 tokens x 28 layers will not finish, so the implementation must vectorize.
   §6.2 already governs: "Every SIMD specialization must produce bit-equal results to the
   scalar reference on the exhaustive edge corpus (§13.1)". The sim's vectorized kernels
   stand in that same relation to `intmath.py`/`rope.py`. Every `vec_*` cell here drives
   the edge corpus, not nominal data — nominal data is where a broken rounding hides.

2. **float64 as an exact integer carrier.** Ruled ACCEPTED, with an envelope guard that
   raises rather than silently losing a bit. Reasoning in the test-design record §3; the
   short form is that int8xint8 over these dot lengths is exactly representable, so the
   carrier is exact AND order-independent — but the margin at a real context cap is
   0.78%, so the guard is load-bearing rather than ceremonial.

3. **Forge W6 — the reason this harness exists.** "torch's default round-half-even
   measures a different pipeline than the one that ships." Every requant goes through
   `intmath.py`. Two cells enforce it: a behavioural tie fixture (decisive, catches the
   substitution however it is spelled) and a monkeypatch sentinel (catches the library
   call at its origin).

§6.8 (D-SLM35) is normative and binds this suite: naming a construction does not
determine its bits. Where §6.8 and a §6 subsection could be read apart, §6.8 governs, and
the cells cite the table row.

**§9 — G-2, real weights, and the spike-grade pipeline (2026-07-15).** The 2026-07-15
record ruled G-2's upstream-fidelity oracle "owed at the spike run" because a self-authored
fixture model has no upstream to be faithful to. **This is the spike run**, so it comes due:
§9's cells pin the float path against HF `transformers` on real Qwen2.5 weights, before the
integer path is allowed to attribute anything to quantization. Without them, "integer
quantization damaged the task" and "we implemented Qwen wrong" are the same number.

# 6a. Weight scales are PER-OUTPUT-CHANNEL (§6.1); activation scales are PER-TENSOR (§6.2)
# ==============================================================================
#
# The plan splits the two granularities and the 2026-07-15 contract collapsed them:
#
#   §6.1 — "W8: symmetric int8, **per-output-channel** static scales, computed offline."
#   §6.2 — "Baseline: static **per-tensor** activation scales, calibrated offline."
#
# `StaticScales.as_multiplier_shift_pairs() -> dict[str, tuple[int, int]]` returned one
# scalar pair per tensor, which forces the weight scale to be folded per-tensor. The
# builder followed the contract faithfully; the defect is the contract's.
#
# **Why it fakes the answer.** Per-tensor weight quantization is materially worse than
# per-channel: one outlier channel dominates the shared scale and crushes the resolution
# of every other channel. That is why §6.1 specifies per-channel. So the sim measured a
# WORSE pipeline than the one that ships, and the error runs toward a **false FAIL** on
# §15's 2-point bar — W8A8 lands low, and "integer quantization damaged the task" and "the
# harness quantized wrong" are indistinguishable at the output. That sends the plan down
# §15's fallback ladder (integer dynamic scales -> QAT -> the encoder pivot) for a defect
# that is not in the design.
#
# The arithmetic §6.1 and §6.2 state together:
#
#     acc[j]   = SUM_i x[i] * W[i][j]                     int32 (C17)
#     real[j] ~= acc[j] * S_x * S_w[j]                    S_x per-tensor, S_w per-channel
#     q_out[j] = requant(acc[j], M[j]), M[j] = S_x * S_w[j] / S_out
#
# so the composed requant multiplier is **per output channel**, and both the multiplier
# and the shift are vectors of length out_channels. See the test-design record §3a for the
# shape's S2 reasoning.

    per-layer output against the float reference on probe inputs, within a stated
    tolerance.

    `red-uncalibrated` (test-design record §6): §13.2 sets the tolerances "from spike
    data", so the threshold is an OUTPUT of T-066, not an input to it. The bound below is
    a placeholder wide enough to catch a structurally wrong layer (a transposed head, a
    missing residual) and too wide to certify quantization damage — which is the spike's
    measurement, not this cell's.

    **CORRECTED 2026-09-02 (T-2553), then RESTORED 2026-09-02 (T-2564, C1):** T-2553
    widened this bound 0.25 -> 0.6 because `softmax.input`'s own static half paired a
    post-norm Q scale with a pre-norm K scale on every QK-norm-bearing layer (layer 1 at
    0.554, over the OLD 0.25 bound) — not ordinary quantization noise but the same
    composition failure C2 named for the engine, in the one arm C2's own fix did not
    reach (`Claude/Poirot/36185a3-t2563-trackb-rebuild-review.md` C1). `_derive_scales`
    now reads the post-norm `k_norm.gain` scale for `softmax.input`'s K half, symmetric
    with `q_scale`'s own reassignment three lines above it. Re-measured against the
    corrected tree: layer 0 unchanged at 0.129, layer 1 drops to 0.125 — both back under
    the original 0.25 bound, which is restored below. What 0.25 now bounds is ordinary
    int8-vs-float64 rounding noise across the fixture's quantized sites, the same class
    this cell's own docstring above states is its actual job — a transposed head or a

#
# §13 item 2a: the pipeline's greedy token sequence "also agrees, >= threshold, with the
# **upstream model's own framework** (HF `transformers`, fp/bf16) on the reference prompts
# — proving the integer pipeline is faithful to the *source model*, not merely
# self-consistent with our own float reference… it catches a faithful-looking but wrong
# reimplementation (wrong RoPE θ, attention scale, QK-norm order) that self-parity ships
# green."
#
# We are hand-implementing Qwen2.5's forward in numpy. Every one of θ, the attention scale,
# QK-norm order, the RoPE pair layout, the SwiGLU gate/up order, and the tied-embedding
# transpose is a place to be wrong in a way that runs, is deterministic, and is not Qwen.
# §13 item 2's parity gate cannot see any of it: it compares our integer path to OUR float
# path, and both would be wrong together.
#
# **These cells gate the integer path.** Until the float path reproduces upstream, no number
# the integer path produces can be attributed to quantization — which is the whole of T-066.

    extraction, which the run drives through a system prompt and the chat template.

    Measured there: the run's prompt is **1786-1885** tokens and a bare-utterance collapse
    would render 8-60, so the bound sits ~1.7x above the widest collapsed record and ~18x
    below the narrowest run prompt. The assertion is the same and the guard still bites; the
    original margins justified it against a tokenizer this cell never calls.

    **This bound is not what makes the fixture's calibration content-blind** — the truncation
    is `_calibrate`'s cap slice, not this cell's floor (P-18/F-1). Raising the fixture's
    `context_cap` to admit the prompt is not the escape: measured, `fixture_model` at
    `context_cap=2048` takes **540 s** to build because it calibrates all 600 records at
