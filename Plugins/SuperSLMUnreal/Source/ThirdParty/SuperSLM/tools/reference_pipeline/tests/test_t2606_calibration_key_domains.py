"""T-2606 -- every maxima key the calibrator feeds `_derive_scales` is observed on ONE
tensor domain: the one its consumer lands onto.

T-2604's localization (Claude/Linnaeus/t2604-qwen3-block0-localization-2026-09-11.md
§1/§4, D-SLM6652, conductor-verified) found the instance: `_float_layer` observes the
raw projected K under `f"{prefix}.k"`, then applies QK-norm and RoPE, then observes the
TRANSFORMED K under that same raw key again (pipeline.py:3196 at faef137), so
`_projection_scale` sizes the raw-K landing grid (`layer{L}.k_proj.requant` /
`k_head{h}.scale`, which `LandTokenKVRow` lands the RAW k_proj accumulator onto BEFORE
`ApplyQkNormSite`'s K branch) from the post-norm peak. On the real Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
artifact that grid is ~89x too coarse and 99.4% of K codes land at zero. The adjacent
comment (pipeline.py:3181-3184) says the raw key is "untouched"; the executable
statement at :3196 contradicts it. The line predates QK-norm support (2026-08-16), when
the second observation differed from raw K only by RoPE (bounded by sqrt(2)) and was
harmless.

This file pins the instance RED (it fails at faef137 for exactly this reason, naming
both peaks) and the CLASS it belongs to: one domain per consumed key, enumerated from
the code at run time (`_derive_scales`'s own maxima reads), with `f"{prefix}.q` -- the
same shape at :3195 -- dispositioned as a second instance. QK-norm K is calibrated by the
QKC1 channel table rather than a maxima key consumed by `_derive_scales`.

The consumer domains are derived from `_derive_scales` (pipeline.py:2112-2332) and the
C++ landings its site constants feed: K's raw accumulator lands through LandTokenKVRow
(src/forward/forward_sites.cpp:1843-1851) before ApplyQkNormSite's K branch
(:1486-1509); Q's raw accumulator funnels through ProjectAndFunnel
(forward_sites.cpp:1816-1822) before ApplyQkNormSite's Q branch normalizes from those
raw codes (q_norm is per-head RMS -- insensitive to the landing scale in the mean, but
a coarser grid degrades the resolution of exactly the codes it normalizes, the same
mechanism as the K defect); the QK-normed K relands through ApplyQkNormSite's second
LandingRescale onto `k_normed_head{h}.scale` and `RopeApplySite` rotates the landed
codes afterward -- which is why that key's domain spans BOTH sides of RoPE.

Red at faef137, by cell (the builder greens them in T-2607; the mutation cells below
are green now and prove the red cells discriminate):
- the raw-K instance cell, the raw-Q second-instance cell, the class cell, and the
  capture cell are RED at faef137;
- the enumeration cell is green at faef137 (it is the guard: it fails when a consumed
  key carries no domain assertion, or when the committed domain list rots).

# Each row: (allowed observation phases, the consumer that lands the key, the tensor
# domain that consumer expects). The phases are the calibration walks' own crossing
# structure, tracked by this file's instrumentation: "pre_qk_norm" (before
# `_apply_qk_norm` -- the raw projection outputs), "post_qk_norm" (after QK-norm,
# before RoPE), "post_rope" (after `_float_rope`), "post_layer" (after `_float_layer`
# returns -- the final-norm region of `_float_forward_many`). A key observed at a
# phase its domain does not span is an observation on a foreign tensor folded into the
# key -- the class T-2604 localized, of which pipeline.py:3196 is the K instance.
#
# `q` and `k` are conditional domains. With QK-norm, their consumers land the RAW
# projection outputs and the post-RoPE values are foreign, post-norm values. Without
# QK-norm, the engine lands those raw codes and rotates them in place, so the same raw-key
# scale must enclose the projection output AND its RoPE image. `_kv_calibration_capture`'s
# own maxima observes `q` (and `attn_norm.out`) too -- the sibling walk Arm D/E's
# `_layer_q_scale` derives Q's production landing scale from -- so its observations are
