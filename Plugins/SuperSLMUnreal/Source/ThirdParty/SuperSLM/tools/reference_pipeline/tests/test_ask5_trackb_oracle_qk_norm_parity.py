"""Ask 5, Track B — the oracle's QK-norm call site is ONE shared implementation, not three
independently-drifting ones (T-2553).

T-2551 gave `_float_layer` a QK-norm call site. `_kv_calibration_capture` (Arm D/E's own
per-head calibration capture) and `_vec_forward` (the integer engine's own Python parity
shadow) each independently re-walk the per-layer forward and had none — an oracle with
multiple forward implementations of which only one applies a real architectural operation is
exactly the shape `StandardsDocument.md` §7's sibling-pinning rule names: a repair (or, here,
an addition) that leaves an unaudited sibling standing inherits whatever the sibling is wrong
about, and the sibling here was wrong about applying QK-norm at all.

T-2553 gives both siblings the identical call, `_apply_qk_norm` (`pipeline.py`) — one shared
function every independent layer walk in this module calls, so there is one QK-norm
composition, never two (or three) reasoned to agree. This file pins that: a fixture with
non-uniform `q_norm`/`k_norm` gains where each sibling's own observable output measurably
differs with the norm applied versus without it — materiality, not merely execution, matching
the same discipline `test_ask5_trackc_qk_norm_converter.py` and T-2551's own build log already
establish for this class of claim (`StandardsDocument.md` §5.4).
