"""End-to-end composition cells for the §15 W8A8-dynamic forward (C23–C30, §17 G-8 items 11–16).

Per-site composition properties: norm scale-kill (C23, item 11), the identity channel's true
pass-through with the executed 25-vs-26 witness (C24, item 12), token-wide fold conformance
(C25, item 12), K/V static per-head landing via the per-key reconciliation (C27, item 14), and
the C30 integration sentinel (out_scale never computed; the derivation routed through the
pinned intmath function — item 16's integration half).

Brief: Claude/Curie/packets/eval/packet-08.md. Trace shape per the A-4-amended pin
(Claude/Curie/SuperSLM_Section15_Eval_TestDesign-2026-07-16.md §13): chain sites carry the
C19-C22 fields plus (m_out, e_out); k/v projection sites are per (token, head) records with a
"head" key, the head's STATIC landing scale as (m_out, e_out), "R_key", and "codes" — and NO
Dprime/Dn/s/R (the C27 landing is a reconciliation to a static target, not the dynamic chain).

Re-authored by Curie 2026-07-16 (verification pass, amendment A-4): the delivered cell 2
construction failed a conformant build (executed: a real non-identity fold on channel 1 moves
that channel's code to 13, so equality-to-pass-through could never hold), cell 4 predated the
per-head trace amendment, and cell 5's smoke call used zero coefficients the pinned
positive-only rule rejects.
