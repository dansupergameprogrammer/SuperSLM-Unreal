"""T-1945 -- mutation pin for the located T-1944 root cause: `calibrate_kv_landing_arm`'s
per-head branch (`pipeline.py`, arms C/D/E) must write `kv_reciprocals[...]` as the
canonical `S_kh / S_ref` RATIO mantissa/exponent/reciprocal triple the runtime's
`LandingRescale` actually consumes, never a reciprocal of the landed scale's own bare
canonical.

Design/grounding of record: `Claude/Popper/t1944-t1942-armcde-collapse-debunk-2026-08-12.md`
§3.1 (the located defect, proven by counter-experiment) and §1's headline; the legacy
per-layer path's own derivation and comment at `pipeline.py:2082-2097`
(`_derive_composition_constants`); the engine consumer at
`D:\\SuperSLM\\include\\superslm\\forward_sites.h:140-175` and `src/model.cpp:736-765`
(`main@727e63e`, read-only grounding) -- `LandingRescale` reads `(r_t, e_t)` from
`KvLandingReciprocals` alone, `KvLandingScales` is never one of its arguments.

**No cell in the suite this file joins ever read the reciprocal triples' own quantity**
before this pin (T-1944's own finding on why four review rounds and 1882 tests missed the
defect: the toy-fixture cells in `test_armd_arme_kv_calibration.py` pin selection distinctness,
softmax_khead regeneration, and sweep behaviour, but assert nothing about what
`kv_reciprocals` itself carries). This file closes exactly that class.

Proven RED against the pre-fix line (`pipeline.py:2458`,
`kv_reciprocals[...] = (m, e, intmath.dynamic_scale_reciprocal(m))`, `weight_scales` gated
to arms D/E only) and GREEN after the fix, by executing both states of the file in-process
-- see `Claude/Brunel/t1945-kv-reciprocal-ratio-fix-2026-08-12.md` for the quoted failure.

    """§3.1's own located property, stated as a positive contract: for every
    `(layer, k_head)` site of every per-head arm, `kv_reciprocals[key]` equals
    `(m_t, e_t, dynamic_scale_reciprocal(m_t))` where `(m_t, e_t) =
    canonical_scale(landed_scale / k_s_ref)`, `landed_scale` reconstructed from the SAME
    `kv_landing[key]` the converter actually wrote, and `k_s_ref` the K projection's own
    reference-fold denominator (`_reference_fold(weight_scales[f"{prefix}.k_proj"])[1]`)
    -- the identical quantity and formula the legacy per-layer path already uses
    (`pipeline.py:2088-2093`) and the engine's `LandingRescale` already consumes
    (`forward_sites.h:140-175`, `model.cpp:736-765`: `(r_t, e_t)` read from
    `KvLandingReciprocals` alone).

    This assertion is computed via a DIFFERENT path than the production write it checks:
    it starts from the OBSERVED `kv_landing[key]` (the converter's own already-written
    landed scale) and this fixture's own independently-fetched `weight_scales`, not from
    any intermediate the production code path shares internally beyond the two primitives
    (`_reference_fold`, `canonical_scale`) both the shipped legacy path and this pin treat
    as already-trusted arithmetic -- the property under test is which OPERANDS feed them,
    not their own correctness.

    **The exponent is asserted exact; the mantissa is asserted within +/-1.** Production
    computes `canonical_scale(selected_scale / k_s_ref)` from the RAW pre-canonicalization
    `selected_scale` (single rounding); this pin can only reconstruct `selected_scale` by
    replaying `kv_landing[key]` (already `canonical_scale`d once) back into a `Fraction`
    and dividing, which rounds a SECOND time. Confirmed by execution: the two paths agree
    on `e_t` exactly at all 12 fixture sites (2 layers x 2 kv_heads x 3 arms), with mantissas
    within +/-1: measured 5 exact, 6 at +1, 1 at -1 (T-1948/D-SLM2689 corrected the earlier
    "exactly 1 at every site" wording) -- the identical double-rounding-
    tie class `Claude/Popper/t1944-t1942-armcde-collapse-debunk-2026-08-12.md` §3.1 point 2
    already names ("double rounding in the reconstruction path -- value agreement <=1e-9,
    not a second defect"). This tolerance cannot mask the actual defect: the pre-fix write
    carries `e_t == kv_landing`'s own unshifted exponent, while the correct ratio's `e_t`
    is shifted by `~log2(1/k_s_ref)` (~7 bits on this fixture, `k_s_ref` measured
    `~1/127`) -- an exponent divergence the exact `e_t` check below catches regardless of
    the mantissa tolerance, and the reciprocal `r_t` is checked for INTERNAL consistency
    with whichever mantissa was actually observed, not tolerance-widened itself.

    RED against the pre-fix line (`kv_reciprocals[...] = (m, e,
    dynamic_scale_reciprocal(m))`, the scale's own bare canonical): every site's observed
    `e_t` equals `kv_landing`'s own unshifted exponent, which disagrees with the ratio's
    shifted `e_t` computed here at every one of the fixture's 4 (layer, k_head) sites
    (`num_hidden_layers=2 * num_key_value_heads=2`) whenever `k_s_ref != 1` (confirmed
    true on this fixture's own pinned weights, verified by execution -- see the build log
    for the quoted failure).
