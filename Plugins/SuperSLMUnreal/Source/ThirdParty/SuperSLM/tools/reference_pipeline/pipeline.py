"""The simulated integer pipeline for the T-066 spike (SuperSLM_Plan.md §15).

§15: "offline Python; simulated integer pipeline in torch — static scales, pinned
requant semantics, i-exp/i-sqrt constructions, RoPE tables — no runtime code
needed." This module is the forward pass that wires `intmath.py`, `rope.py`, and
`constrain.py` into a Llama-family decode (§5 / D-SLM8: RMSNorm, RoPE,
grouped-query attention, SwiGLU MLP, tied embeddings).

Three properties are structural here rather than incidental:

**Every rounding on the reproducible path is `intmath.py`'s** (§15 / Forge W6). No
library rounding runs between token input and token output — the vectorized kernels
below reimplement the gemmlowp primitives in numpy and are held to §6.2's bar:
bit-equal to the scalar reference on the exhaustive edge corpus. `forward_scalar_reference`
is what the fast path is bit-equal *to*, and it is the normative one.

**float64 is an exact integer carrier, and the envelope is checked.** int8 x int8
over the §5 dot lengths peaks 6e7 times under 2^53, so every partial sum is exactly
representable, so the float accumulation is exact and — the property worth having —
order-independent. The headroom is operand-width-specific: int32 probabilities
against int8 values break at dot length 33,026, and Qwen2.5's own context cap of
32,768 sits at 99.2% of it. `assert_exact_accumulation` is therefore wired into
`int_matmul` at the true break point, and the carrier's exit is a **cast, not a
round**: a rounding step there hides the violation the guard exists to raise.

**Static scales are constants of the model** (D-SLM5). They are calibrated offline at model
construction — `fixture_model` or `load_model` — and read, never computed, by `forward`.
`compute_activation_scale` is §6.2's spike-gated dynamic fallback and the baseline never
calls it. Calibration reads the **whole** frozen §4 corpus (Dan, 2026-07-15), so §11's
reproducibility formula carries the calibration corpus's hash and that hash is sufficient:
it determines the scales on its own, with no draw for the formula to express.

**Calibration observes the prompt the run decodes.** §6.2 calibrates "on a task-representative
corpus", and the run does not decode a corpus record's utterance — it decodes
`baseline.SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `baseline.build_prompt(record)` through the checkpoint's chat
template. Encoding the bare utterance set every per-tensor activation scale from 5-17 tokens
while the run processes 463-475, so the ~450-token system prompt — the most plausible home for
a massive activation, and §6.2's known cost is precisely "quality on outlier-heavy
activations" — was invisible to the scales that quantize it. `run_token_ids` is the one
construction and `calibration_token_ids` is defined as it, so the two cannot drift apart; the
prompt itself is imported from `reference_pipeline.calibration_prompt` (extracted verbatim from `baseline.py`, §3.2) rather than restated, so there is one of it.

**`load_model` is what makes the spike's number mean anything.** `fixture_model` was the
only `QuantizedModel` constructor and its weights are a bit-mix of each tensor's **name
string** — right for CI, where determinism is a property of the arithmetic, and exactly wrong
for a measurement of task quality. The weight map is total: an unmapped or missing tensor is
a hard rejection (§11's N3), because a silently-skipped projection is a model that loads,
runs, generates fluent text, and is not the source model.

**The float reference is the unquantized model, streamed per tensor.** §13 item 2 measures
quantization *against* it, so a reference rebuilt by dequantizing the int8 weights would
compare the integer path to itself and report zero damage. It is the same fact as the memory
one: the originals are already float in the checkpoint, and materialising 1.5B of them in
float64 at once is 11.5 GiB.

**The KV cache and the RoPE hoist are determinism changes wearing performance clothes.** Both
are required to be bit-identical to the paths they replace, and that is asserted rather than
argued: a cache is a *different computation* the moment a reduction order, a requant, or a
position index moves, and one wrong bit at step k propagates to every token after it.

**Weight scales are per output channel; activation scales are per tensor.** §6.1 pins
"W8: symmetric int8, per-output-channel static scales"; §6.2 pins "static per-tensor
activation scales". So at a projection the composed requant multiplier inherits the
weight's granularity —

    acc[j]   = SUM_i x[i] * W[i][j]
    q_out[j] = requant(acc[j], M[j]),  M[j] = S_x * S_w[j] / S_out

— and both the multiplier and the shift are vectors of length `out_channels`. They are
carried as two parallel arrays rather than a list of pairs: §6.2 pins gemmlowp by
reference implementation and the reference's per-axis API is two `int32*` arrays, which
§6.8's "pin the reference" rule makes normative rather than a matter of taste.

**§6.8 PIN OWED rows are not invented here.** C7/C8 (i-exp coefficients and clip
bound), C9 (softmax construction), and C10 (SwiGLU SiLU construction) are owed at S2.
This module composes the constructions `intmath.py` already implements rather than
choosing numbers for them, and emits no golden hash: per §6.8, no conformance is
claimed against a row that is not a number. The spike answers format-lock, which is a
property of the pipeline class; the golden waits for S2.

    **§11's N3 discipline governs this map** -- "an unrecognized ... constant in the config
    is a hard rejection, never a silent drop" -- for the same reason it governs the config: a
    quietly-dropped projection is a model that loads, runs, generates fluent text, and is
    not Qwen. Every REQUIRED entry -- the embedding, the final norm, every per-layer
    projection, and each layer's own `attn_norm`/`mlp_norm` gains (T-2549 N-5: named
    explicitly here, not as "its two norm gains" -- QK-norm's own two gains are a
    DIFFERENT, OPTIONAL pair, stated two paragraphs below; the prior phrasing was
    ambiguous between the two in a docstring rewritten precisely because its predecessor
    made a false totality claim) -- is compared against the checkpoint's key set in both
    directions by the caller (`load_model`'s own `unmapped`/`missing` checks) and either
    difference is a rejection.

    **T-2543 S-1/S-3 correction: "total" no longer means every entry this map CAN produce is
    always produced.** Three groups of entries are OPTIONAL, checkpoint-driven, and gated
    independently on that exact tensor's own presence in `present`, never assumed: the three
    q/k/v projection biases per layer (Qwen2.5 biases q/k/v unconditionally; this ask's own
    candidate biases none), the two QK-norm gains per layer (the reverse), and `lm_head`
    (present only when `tie_word_embeddings` is false AND the checkpoint carries it). Gating
    these is what lets a checkpoint carrying none of them (the legacy convention) and a
    checkpoint carrying all of them (this ask's own candidate) both survive this map's own
    totality check unmodified -- the backward-compatibility acceptance cell this gate exists
    to keep passing. What stays total: every gated entry that IS added is added consistently
    with the checkpoint's own real key set, so a caller iterating this map's keys against
    `present` still finds the two sets equal -- totality now applies to "what the map claims
    given what the checkpoint carries," not to "every group is always non-empty."

    `present` is the checkpoint's own observed tensor-name set, computed by the caller from
    the real, on-disk checkpoint before this function is called -- never guessed.

    **T-2543 C-1, asymmetric QK-norm presence.** A checkpoint carrying `q_norm.weight` for a
    layer without `k_norm.weight`, or vice versa, is REJECTED by name here rather than
    silently mapping the one present and skipping the other -- design §4
    (`t2408-superslm-ask5-qwen3-arch-design-2026-08-29.md#4-gating`) states this combination
    is "a defined rejection, not two independent null checks." The design's own primary
    enforcement point is the C++ layer marshal (`layer_marshal.h`'s `MarshalLayer`, Track B,
    unbuilt and out of this track's own scope), which rejects at LOAD time; this converter-
    side check is the identical invariant enforced earlier, at CONVERT time, for free at the
    point this map is already reading the checkpoint's own key set -- rejecting a defect
    earlier never contradicts a design that also rejects it later.

    header bytes alone, before any tensor payload is read (§11 reject-over-degrade).

    The consistency proof is built from `owner` -- the shards' own headers, read directly,
    never from trusting `weight_map` alone. Six distinct failure modes (T-1912 design §4.4),
    checked in this order: mode 0 (an unsafe shard-name value) first, since nothing else is

    weight_map does not), mode 3 (weight_map names a tensor no shard header contains), and
    mode 4 (weight_map attributes a tensor to the wrong shard).

    non-`str` -- so validating a value AFTER either operation lets the untrusted value
    reach a `TypeError`-raising collection primitive before `_require_safe_shard_filename`'s
    own `isinstance` guard ever runs. The boundary this class holds is a property of each
    raw value at the moment it is used, never of a collection built from those values.
    Mode 1 asks `is_file()`, not `exists()` (T-1924 S2, T-1929). On this host (Windows,
    confirmed on `Windows-10-10.0.19045` / CPython 3.13.6; not executed elsewhere),

    never returns and never raises); `NUL` does not hang -- it returns EOF immediately and

    `is_file()` is confirmed False for both `CON` and `NUL` and True for a real shard, on

    `fixture_model` was the only constructor, and its weights are a deterministic bit-mix of
    each tensor's **name string**. That fixture is right for CI — determinism is a property of
    the arithmetic, not of whether the model is any good — and it asks the opposite question
    from the spike: a run over it would emit arithmetic noise in exactly the right format to be
    quoted as T-066's answer.

    Every rejection here is §11's reject-over-degrade for a REQUIRED tensor: an unmapped
    tensor, a missing REQUIRED tensor, or a shape that contradicts `config.json` fails the
    load, never a silent skip.

    **T-2543 S-3 correction.** Three tensor groups are OPTIONAL and gated on the checkpoint's
    own presence, not on this reject-over-degrade rule: q/k/v biases, QK-norm
    (`_upstream_names`'s own docstring states both, and asymmetric QK-norm presence is
    still a hard rejection -- only symmetric presence/absence degrades), and `lm_head` when
    `tie_word_embeddings` is false. The third is a genuine, checked-in degradation this
    round leaves as the frozen design's own accept-side cell states it (`t2408` §6 Track C,
    fold round 3, CKN-04's second acceptance cell): an untied checkpoint with no
    `lm_head.weight` loads successfully here and fails later, at the first consumer that
    reads the head (`forward_float_reference`/`lm_head_weight`, both `KeyError('lm_head')`)
    -- no real checkpoint is known to take this shape (HuggingFace's own
    `AutoModelForCausalLM` always materializes a separate `lm_head` when embeddings are
    untied), so this is an accepted, named residual on a hypothetical input, not a silent
    trap on a real one.

    `extra_tensors` and `require_tensors` exist for the rejection cells: they add names to
    the observed and to the demanded key sets respectively, so both directions of the map's
    totality can be driven without a corrupt checkpoint on disk. Since CKN-01 (T-2539),
    `extra_tensors` ALSO participates in `present` before `_upstream_names` builds the map
    -- it can supply the namespace anchor a synthetic fixture needs, or add tensors that get
    gated INTO the map (a synthetic bias or QK-norm entry), not only tensors that end up
    unmapped.

    `tokenize_prompt` defaults to the checkpoint's own chat template and tokenizer — the
    encoder the run decodes through. It is a parameter and not a choice: whichever encoder
    produces the scales is recorded in the artifact (`CalibrationRecord.tokenization`), because
    the same checkpoint and the same hashed corpus under two encoders are two artifacts.

    calibration with an order-dependent step (a running mean, an early stop, a top-k over a
    stream) could not be expressed by the terms the artifact records.

    Each sequence is truncated to the model's context cap. This is NOT what the run does with
    the same input: §6.8 C12 makes a position at or past the cap a rejection, so `forward`
    raises `UnsupportedOpSet` on an over-cap sequence where `_calibrate` returns from a silently
    truncated one. Measured 2026-07-15 on the §11 fixture (cap 16): a 1813-token render rejects
    through `forward` and calibrates through this function.

    Calibration therefore degrades where the run rejects, and §11/N3 is reject-over-degrade.
    Whether this function must reject instead of truncate is an open question with the planner
    (Curie P-18/F-1) — it extends N3 to a surface N3 does not name, and it is not decided here.
    The truncation is retained meanwhile because the §11 fixture calibrates all 600 records at
    construction, so a rejection would make the fixture unbuildable and ~40 cells build one
    (Curie P-18/F-2).

    For the §16 nominees the cap never fires: Qwen2.5's cap is 32,768 and the run's prompt is

    scale here, which makes C27/D-SLM57's per-head attn_ctx pre-fold the all-identity fold
    on this artifact (every head already at `max_head S_v`) — sound, but degenerate; a
    real per-head calibration would exercise the fold's non-identity branch.

    `scales` — `StaticScales.scale(f"{prefix}.retired-K-head scale")`, the value

    old unconditional-iteration behavior for a caller's own ad hoc callable that offers no

    For each candidate `k` in `_ARMD_ARME_SWEEP_OFFSETS`, K is quantized to int8 at
    `base_scale * 2**(k/8)`; Q is quantized once, at `q_scale`, held fixed. The real

    `q_scale * candidate_scale / sqrt(head_dim)` (`pipeline.py`'s own `softmax.input`/

    mask, to the float reference's own `q @ k.T / sqrt(head_dim)` -- never a proxy on the
    composite scalar in isolation (§31.4.1's own pinned metric definition). Saturation
    (the fraction of K int8 codes landing at +-127) is computed and reported for every

    (§31.4.1). `arm` is one of `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, `"D"`, `"E"` (the design's own
    letters).

    Arms A/B (`granularity="per_layer"`) reuse the EXISTING, unchanged production
    calibration (`_calibrate`/`_derive_scales`/`_derive_composition_constants`) rather
    than reimplementing it -- ordering is their only distinguishing axis and this
    function does not simulate the runtime's own legacy-vs-fused landing arithmetic (a
    C++ engine concern, §31.2), so A and B are computed identically here and
    distinguished only by the `"ordering"` label the caller reads.

    Arms C/D/E (`granularity="per_head"`) are captured via `_kv_calibration_capture`,
    which keeps per-head detail the legacy path's own `_observe` collapse discards. C's
    own selected scale is the per-head max-abs directly (no sweep — §31.4.1/§31.4.2 name
    a score-error sweep for D/E only). D/E additionally run the 13-candidate
    score-error-minimizing sweep (`_armd_arme_candidate_sweep`); their kv_landing/
    softmax_khead is the sweep's own winner, and `"candidates"`/`"selected_offset"` are
    populated (T-1933 §0's own contract: these two keys exist for arms D/E only).

    `eval_ids`, optional: the grading corpus's own document IDs (§31.4.2's 239-document
    `tuned_on` population, in production). When given, every `records` entry must carry
    an `"id"` key and `check_calibration_eval_disjoint` runs before any capture or sweep
    work, refusing with `CalibrationPopulationOverlap` on any collision -- §31.4.1's own
    "structural, not merely stated" requirement (D-SLM2557) for this function, the actual
    capture path the per-head candidate sweep runs through, rather than a separate check a
    caller must remember to invoke alongside it (T-1936 §5.4, D-SLM2625). Omitted (the
    default, and every call this contract's frozen §0 signature already makes) performs no
    check -- there is no second population to be disjoint from.
