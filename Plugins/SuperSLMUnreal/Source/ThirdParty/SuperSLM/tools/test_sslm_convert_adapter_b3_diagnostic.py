"""Brunel's T-2201 pins for the two D-SLM3724-investigation remedies (B3 review gate):

1. The `_b3_pair_diagnostic` mean-conjunct margins (`composed_mean`, `effect_mean`) no longer carry
   the spurious `+1.645` SE constant that came from grading a VALIDATION-partition `upper_ci`
   (which already embeds `+1.645*se`) against a Delta, rather than the partition's own `mean` --
   the exact fix specified against the design's own §26.9 lineage. The fixture values pinned below
   (`test_real_shopkeeper_*`, `test_consumer_five_artifact_band_*`) are not invented: they reproduce
   -- via the smallest two-point construction that reaches the same mean/SE the real run measured --
   the exact raw and corrected `margin_se` figures already executed and recorded in the T-2201
   investigation (`Claude/Brunel/t2201-b3-gate-investigation-2026-08-20.md` Sec1.2 and Sec4,
   Wizard repo): the real shopkeeper adapter's own three real pairs that fail to survive the
   correction, and Thomas's consumer-reported `layer4.up_proj` pair, whose raw margin sits in the
   3.0-3.5 SE band the investigation names as the shape shared by five of his six flagged pairs.
   Because `margin = (point - Delta)/se [+ 1.645 iff point is upper_ci]` is a pure algebraic
   identity, any two-point draw array reaching the same (mean, se, Delta) as the real run reproduces
   the real run's own margin figure exactly -- this is a reconstruction of the recorded arithmetic,
   not a new synthetic scenario.

2. (RETIRED, T-2213/D-SLM3783) The pooled primary gate's own `accepted=True`/`accepted=False`
   reading no longer exists -- the pooled ACCEPT/REJECT arithmetic itself was retired, not merely
   reworded. What this remedy's cells below now pin is the CURRENT notice: an explicit, ID-free
   status statement printed at every site the tool prints the pooled REPORT (the `--verbose`
   build-log line inside `build_runtime_additive_sections`, and `main()`'s own accept branch --
   there is no longer a B3-driven reject branch, since nothing B3 computes can refuse to write an
   artifact any more). It states plainly that the per-pair diagnostics are this tool's primary B3
   review signal, that a flagged pair is worth a closer look and not a confirmed finding, that an
   empty per-pair list is not proof of soundness, and what the new magnitude sanity check does and
   does not do (a coarse, wide-tolerance WARNING, never a REJECT -- commissioned separately in
   `test_sslm_convert_adapter_b3_magnitude.py`).
