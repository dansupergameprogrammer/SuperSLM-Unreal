// T-2039 (real-capacity shader geometry), T-2045 C1 fix (Claude/Poirot/
// 82cfca7-gpu-serial-port-build-review.md): RoPE -- real GPU dispatch, site 4
// of 16. Bit-exact port of forward_sites.cpp's RopeApplySite
// (forward_sites.cpp:639-737) in full, plus the per-head Q/K composition
// RunLayerLoopImpl drives it with (forward_sites.cpp:1546-1585) -- Q rotated
// into LayerScratch's own q_rot slot (never in-place -- Sec4: Q's own output
// is never landed), K read from the just-landed KV cache row, rotated, and
// written back to the SAME row (option_g_fused_k_landing is always false at
// this design's build target, D-SLM2994).
//
// C1: K's own write-back is now the design's own ruled STAGED shape
// (Sec5.6, D-SLM2993) -- "the RoPE dispatch computes every head's rotation
// (Q and K) into per-thread-group scratch first, synchronizes... and commits
// the rotated K rows into the persistent K store" -- not the prior
// in-loop read-rotate-write, which raced across every query head sharing one
// K row under grouped query attention (`group = num_attention_heads /
// num_key_value_heads`, e.g. 6 at the real 1.5B-Instruct tier): a thread
// whose read landed after another thread's write would rotate an
// already-rotated row. CPU's own two-loop separation
// (forward_sites.cpp:1546-1585) is the model, and its own comment states the
// property this shape restores: "every read above happens before any write
// here, so no partially-rotated store is ever observed." Phase 1 below reads
// every OWNED head's pre-rotation K bytes into a per-thread WorkScratch
// slice (ROPE_STAGE, `superslm_gpu.cpp`'s own `work_rope_stage_off`); a
// `DeviceMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync()` then forces every thread's phase-1
// KvCache reads to complete before any thread's phase-2 KvCache write
// becomes possible; phase 2 rotates from the STAGED bytes (never re-reading
// KvCache) and writes back. Multiple heads sharing a kv_head still stage,
// rotate, and write redundantly (matching CPU's own "redundant but sound"),
// but every one computes the identical rotation from the identical
// pre-rotation input, so the redundant writes -- now safely ordered after
// every read -- converge on the same bytes regardless of which thread's
// commit lands last.
//
// Rebuilt to the design's own production dispatch geometry (Sec5.4/Sec5.5):
// numthreads(256,1,1), attention heads partitioned across the group via
// N-per-thread striding (each thread owns a disjoint subset of heads and
// runs that head's own head_dim/2-pair rotation loop to completion), driven
// entirely by the real g_head_dim/g_num_attention_heads root constants.
//
// T-2113 (B4, design Sec3/Sec6.1, re-derived from Claude/Laplace/t2105-gpu-speed-ceiling-
// 2026-08-14.md Sec2 change 6): two changes, both of the same class as the GEMM sites' own
// multi-group split.
//
// (1) FLATTENED. Every phase below iterated `for (h = t; h < g_num_attention_heads; h +=
//     256)` -- twelve of 256 threads doing all the work at the real 1.5B tier, in one group.
//     The real independent work item is a (head, rotation pair): num_attention_heads *
//     head_dim/2 of them, each rotating one disjoint (x,y) pair. Flattened over that and
//     gridded.
//
// (2) The K COMMIT phase moved to its OWN dispatch (rope_commit_site.hlsl). The
//     DeviceMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync that used to separate stage from commit is
//     GROUP-scoped, so it orders only the 256 threads of one group -- going multi-group
//     under it would be unsound, which is precisely why the split is a second dispatch
//     rather than a wider one. The global UAV barrier `bind_and_dispatch` issues between the
//     two dispatches is strictly stronger than the group barrier it replaces: it orders
//     EVERY thread of the stage dispatch before EVERY thread of the commit dispatch, which
//     is the read-before-write property D-SLM2993's own shape exists to establish. It is
//     also what makes this site time-slice invariant -- the two dispatches may land in
//     different command lists submitted in different slices with a fence between them and
//     the bytes do not change, which was NOT true of a group barrier.
