// Sec4.1.1/Sec5.1/Sec5.3, Sec10 B1/B2/B3).
//
// B1's own gate (design Sec10): "existing suite green, unchanged behavior when
// exactly one context is created (a same-process, same-thread equivalence check
// against the substrate's own current single-call behavior)". Concretely: this file
// adds a NEW, additive construction (SslmGpuContext, its own owned harness::Device
// and PSO/root-sig caches) that touches none of the pre-1.0 substrate's own process-
// global statics (`harness::GetDevice()`, `harness::GetOrBuildPipeline`,
// `harness::GetOrBuildComposedPipeline`, all still defined in d3d12_harness.h and
// still used unchanged by `RunLayerLoopGpu` and every other pre-1.0 entry point in
// superslm_gpu.cpp) -- so the existing test suite (tests\test_main.cpp,
// out\superslm_tests.exe) observes zero behavior change. The migration that actually
// removes the pre-1.0 singleton usage from RunLayerLoopGpu's own dispatch-recording
// path is B2/B4's job (design Sec10: B2 folds the T-2105 residency construction onto
// the model handle's own upload path; B4 ports the dispatch geometry onto the new
// handle shapes) -- B1 only builds the object the later sections will route weights,
// PSOs, and dispatches through instead of the singleton, per D-SLM3294's own
// "no process-global device state in the 1.0 backend" requirement (design Sec1).
//
// Symbols DEFINED here: sslm_gpu_context_create, sslm_gpu_context_destroy.
// Every other declaration in include/superslm/gpu_1p0.h stays declared-only until
// its own B-section lands (B2 through B9); this file is the single production TU
// the whole 1.0 API grows in, one B-section at a time -- calling out its own
// section boundary in comments as later sections extend it, mirroring

// T-2113 (B8, design Sec5.4/Sec10 B8): thread-safety contract, stated here because this is
// where every thread-shared object this design names actually lives.
//
//   - The PSO/root-signature caches above and `device` are immutable-after-populate for the
//     RESIDENCY half of this object's life (map/create time) and are never touched by the
//     decode dispatch path at all (see the next bullet) -- reading them concurrently is safe.
//   - `SslmGpuModelHandle`/`SslmGpuAdapterHandle`: read-only for the whole of their lifetime
//     after `map` returns (design Sec5.4) -- safe for any number of threads to read (bind,
//     dispatch against, or call `sslm_gpu_seq_embed_token` through) concurrently, by
//     construction, since nothing ever writes to resident weight/adapter/embed buffers again.
//   - `SslmGpuSequenceHandle`: owns state private to itself. Two threads each driving a
//     DIFFERENT sequence handle through `sslm_decode_step_gpu`/`sslm_gpu_ready`/
//     `sslm_gpu_seq_embed_token` touch disjoint per-sequence memory -- this is "thread-safe
//     execution over disjoint sequences" (D-SLM3294), true by construction once the handle's
//     own ownership split holds. Two threads driving the SAME sequence handle concurrently is
//     a caller error this design does not guard against structurally (proven, not assumed: the
//     T-2112 suite's own dim3 M2 cell reproduces a real D3D12 device fault doing exactly this,
//     `Claude/Brunel/t2113-1p0-core-build-2026-08-15.md` Sec11.4) -- named as a residual, never
//     silently treated as safe.
//   - **The one thing this design deliberately does NOT make safe without caller help**: the
//     actual GPU submission every `sslm_decode_step_gpu`/`_batch_gpu`/`sslm_gpu_ready(block=1)`
//     call performs. Design Sec5.4: "the command queue and descriptor-heap allocator are not
//     safe to submit-from or allocate-from concurrently without external synchronization; this
//     design does not build an internal queue-level lock (Sec13's own deferral: 'speculative
//     concurrency infrastructure the product does not yet need') -- a caller driving two
//     threads' decode calls through one context's queue concurrently must serialize the submit
//     call itself." **Grounded, not merely quoted from the design**: as of B5-B7, the decode
//     dispatch path (`RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit`/`RunLayerLoopGpuFinish`, superslm_gpu.cpp) does not
//     even route through THIS context's own `device` above -- it still calls the pre-1.0
//     substrate's process-WIDE `harness::GetDevice()` singleton (`SubmitOneSequenceDecode`'s own
//     `(void)ctx;` -- ctx is not read for dispatch purposes at all, only for residency lookups
//     upstream of it). So the serialization requirement is, today, PROCESS-wide, not merely
//     per-context: any two threads anywhere in the process that call a decode-touching function
//     concurrently, on any context, must be externally serialized at that call boundary, or the
//     shared allocator's `Reset()` races exactly the way the undrained-batch hang (D-SLM3384,
//     `Claude/Brunel/t2113-1p0-core-build-2026-08-15.md` Sec12.2) already proved by execution --
//     that hang is this same hazard's sequential-but-undrained shape; two genuinely concurrent
//     threads racing the identical `Reset()` is the stronger, race-condition form of it. B8's own
//     bench tool (`tools/t2113_b8_thread_smoke.cpp`) is built to this documented discipline: a
//     mutex external to this API wraps exactly the decode-submit-and-drain call pair, nothing
//     more -- proving the design's own "disjoint sequences, externally serialized only at the
//     queue-submit boundary" claim holds, without this file adding the internal lock the design
//     explicitly declines to build (Sec13's own deferral row, dated, routed: "if evidence arrives
//     that a caller needs concurrent submission through one shared queue... add the lock... as
//     its own scoped follow-on, not retrofitted here"). Migrating the decode dispatch path onto
//     this context's OWN `device` (making the requirement genuinely per-context rather than
//     process-wide) is out of B8's own scope -- named here, dated, the same class of routed item
//     `g_resident_rope`'s own retirement note already established (Sec6.3 of the build log).

// T-2243 review finding 2 (D-SLM4113): a process-global in-flight submission count, scoped to
// what the guarded resource actually is. The comment block above already establishes that the
// decode dispatch path does not route through any per-context `device` -- it calls the pre-1.0
// substrate's process-WIDE `harness::GetDevice()` singleton, with ONE command allocator and ONE
// command list shared by every context and every model in the process. `sslm_gpu_seq_restore`'s
// own guard against that singleton's `dev.alloc->Reset()`/`dev.list->Reset(...)` therefore cannot
// be scoped to a single model's `submitted_sequences` (a sibling in flight on a DIFFERENT model,
// or on a different context, reaches the identical Reset() against an executing allocator) -- it
// has to be scoped to the resource, which is process-global. Incremented/decremented at exactly

// recording code can bind the right sub-range without re-deriving the packing.

// gets its OWN `ExecuteCommandLists`/`Signal` pair underneath, not the ONE-command-list fusion
// design Sec7's own text describes ("records n sequences ... into ONE command list and
// submits/fences them together"). The CORRECTNESS contract this section's own gate names
// (design Sec10 B7: "per sequence, output bit-identical to that same sequence decoded alone")
// is satisfied by construction -- reusing the exact same, already-proven submission call for
// every sequence makes bit-identity to the serial case a property of the code being literally
// the same code, not a separately-proven claim -- and the per-sequence `out_statuses`/
// batch-wide-budget/mixed-adapter semantics are fully and correctly implemented. What is NOT
// realized is the submission-side throughput amortization design Sec7 names as the batching
// mechanism's OWN rationale (a real, but explicitly out-of-scope-for-this-gate, cost: design
// Sec13 states the batch call's own throughput is "UNDERIVED... an empirical question," never
// a design-time claim, and Sec10 B7's own gate text is itself "a correctness proof, not a
// throughput proof"). §14's own throughput measurement, below, reports this honestly rather
// than assuming batching helps.
//
// **A REAL device hang, found at the bench, is why this is not merely a missed optimization**:
// every 1.0-API decode call -- single or batched -- ultimately submits through the process's ONE
// shared `harness::GetDevice()` singleton (every `SslmGpuContext::device`, B1, is used only for
// RESIDENCY uploads at map/create time, never for the decode dispatch chain itself, which the
// pre-1.0 substrate's own `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` still routes through the singleton).
// `ID3D12CommandAllocator::Reset()` is undefined behavior while a command list allocated from it
// is still executing on the GPU -- calling `SubmitOneSequenceDecode` for `seqs[1]` before
// `seqs[0]`'s own fence has signaled resets that SAME shared allocator out from under a submission
// that may still be executing. A first draft of this function left every recorded sequence
// Submitted (undrained) until the whole loop finished, matching the design's own async-batch
// framing literally -- and hung the test process indefinitely on the very first multi-sequence
// batch it ever ran (`t2113_b7_batch_smoke.cpp`'s own Gate 1a, reproduced by execution: 12.12
// CPU-seconds, motionless, for several minutes -- a real device-level stall, not a slow
// computation). Fixed below: each sequence is drained via the public `sslm_gpu_ready(block=1)`
// the INSTANT its own submission succeeds, before the loop's next iteration can touch the shared
// allocator again -- at most one sequence is ever Submitted against the device at once. This is
// the same constraint that makes the "ONE command list" fusion design Sec7 describes a genuine
// correctness requirement for a from-scratch implementation, not merely a throughput nicety --
// this implementation avoids needing that fusion by never having two sequences in flight
// simultaneously in the first place, at the cost named above (no cross-sequence submission
// overlap, so no submission-side amortization either).

	// -- and every earlier sub-chunk's fence wait ran with `model->submitted_sequences == 0`,
	// exactly the reachable consequence the T-2184 review named, still reachable across the
	// other 96.8% of the call. The window now opens HERE, before the first sub-chunk is ever
	// submitted, so every sub-chunk's own fence wait -- not only the final one -- falls inside it;
	// `seq->in_flight` is assigned once the call returns the final sub-chunk's own inflight token
	// (the only one handed back to this caller unfenced; every earlier one already completed
	// inside the call).

	// Claude/Poirot/8642652-t2186-t2169-fix2-confirmation.md): opening and closing this window as
	// two separate manual statements -- open here, close unconditionally below -- was NOT
	// symmetric with the shipped per-token path in the property that matters: the call in between
	// can throw. `SubmitChunkToFullDepthForG5Bridge`'s own tail
	// (`SubmitOneSubChunkToFullDepthForG5Bridge`'s closing statements -- `dev.list->Close()`,
	// `dev.queue->Signal()`, `new GpuLayerLoopInFlight()`, cited by name, not line) sits OUTSIDE that
	// function's own try/catch, so a failed `Close()`/`Signal()` (`SSLM_GPU_HR` throws
	// `std::runtime_error` -- precisely the device-removed channel design Sec9 promises is
	// deliverable) or a `std::bad_alloc` from the `new` can escape this call with no catch
	// anywhere between here and the ABI boundary. A manual "close below" statement is never
	// reached on that path: `seq->state` stays `Submitted` and `model->submitted_sequences` stays
	// incremented forever, and `sslm_gpu_model_unmap` (`SslmGpuModelHandle::submitted_sequences`'
	// own check, above) returns `SSLM_BUSY` on every later call, permanently -- the model can
	// never be unmapped. The shipped per-token twin (`SubmitOneSequenceDecode`, this file,
	// `:1379-1381`'s own comment: "Rejected before submission (a guard, or an exception) -- seq/
	// host state untouched, still Idle") avoids this class entirely by opening its window only
	// AFTER submission returns; this batched path cannot do the same (design Sec9 wants the
	// window held across the whole chunk, submitted or not, not only after it succeeds), so it is
	// made safe by construction instead: an RAII guard opens the window in its constructor and
	// closes it in its destructor, which C++ runs on every exit from this function -- normal
	// return AND exception unwind alike -- so there is no longer any path between open and close
	// where a throw can leave the window stuck open. This replaces the manual open above and the
	// manual unconditional close that used to sit after the call, below; the close is no longer a
	// second statement that can be skipped, it is a property of the guard's lifetime.
