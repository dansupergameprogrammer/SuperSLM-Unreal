// sslm_abi.cpp -- T-2139 (Brunel): C1 (sizing/construction) + C2 (model lifecycle) of the
// Layer-1 CPU-side sslm_* consumer C ABI, built to Claude/Vitruvius/
// t2133-layer1-c-abi-design-2026-08-16.md (Wizard repo). See include/superslm/sslm_abi.h's own
// header comment for the surface this file discharges and what remains undefined.
//
// SCOPE (StandardsDocument Sec5.5): this file defines exactly the ten verbs C1/C2 name --
// sslm_workspace_size, sslm_kv_block_size, sslm_kv_pool_overhead_size, sslm_seq_state_size,
// sslm_workspace_create, sslm_workspace_destroy, sslm_kv_pool_create, sslm_kv_pool_destroy,
// sslm_model_map, sslm_model_unmap -- and nothing past them. C3-C7's verbs are declared in the
// header (for Gate A's own whole-header coverage) but not defined here.
//
// SIZING FORMULAS (Claude/Brunel/t2139-abi-build-2026-08-16.md Sec4, the buffer-mapping ruling,
// design commit fab235c1c6). sslm_workspace_size's exact byte count and sslm_workspace_create's
// alignment requirement are this design's own "opaque to the caller, self-describing internally"
// layout (design Sec7.1).
//
// S7, ROUND 2 (coordinator's closing-round brief, following Claude/Poirot/
// 2c18dab-t2139-abi-build-review.md's own S7 finding and Curie's real dim7 red pin,
// tests/t2138-abi-red-suite/dim7_contract_red.cpp TestDim7_C1, curie/t2138-abi-red-suite@f229449):
// EVERY allocation this file's own code makes on the sslm_prefill/sslm_prefix_prefill/
// sslm_decode_step call graph is now carved from a caller-supplied, correctly-sized workspace
// when one is provided -- sslm_decode_step's own per-token scratch (embed codes, final-norm
// codes, wide logits, the narrowed logit row) AND PrefillWholeTokens' own embed_codes (shared by
// sslm_prefill/sslm_prefix_prefill, the SAME workspace region decode_step uses, since one
// workspace handle is never read by two calls concurrently -- design Sec8.3/dim8 M1's own
// "successive, not concurrent" sharing contract). `layers_scratch` (both call sites) stays
// unthreaded -- it is only allocated at all when an adapter is bound (the common no-adapter case
// makes zero allocation there already, ResolveLayers' own early return), and a
// std::vector<superslm::LayerWeights> is not POD bytes this byte-oriented workspace layout can
// safely describe without a much larger, riskier placement-new scheme; disclosed, not fixed, this
// round.
//
// S7, ROUND 3 (arc-final closing round, design commit 959336ad64's own recalibration; curie/
// t2138-abi-red-suite@11e7182's own recalibrated dim7 C1a/C1b cells). The ruled contract narrowed
// to what THIS ABI layer controls (true engine-wide zero-allocation is D-SLM3457's own later,
// separate inventory) -- and one real ABI-layer gap remained inside that narrowed contract:
// sslm_decode_step's own ready_for_logits path (the one call shape that skips RunLayerLoop
// entirely -- no engine-internal-scratch exception applies there at all) measured 1 allocation
// against a ruled 0. Traced with a WITH-vs-WITHOUT-workspace differential (the technique C1a's own
// second half uses) to RmsNormSite's own internal `wide` scratch for the final_norm call this file
// makes directly. FIXED FOR REAL: RmsNormSite (forward_sites.h/.cpp) gained a trailing, defaulted
// `external_wide_scratch` parameter -- nullptr (every pre-existing call site, unchanged behavior)
// keeps the original internal allocation; this file's own final_norm call in sslm_decode_step now
// passes a `WorkspaceLayout::rms_wide` region carved from the caller's workspace, eliminating the
// allocation for real rather than reporting it as engine-internal-and-out-of-scope -- unlike
// RunLayerLoop's own much larger, deeply nested per-layer scratch (attention-interior temporaries,
// matmul accumulators, softmax rows -- dozens of std::vector locals per layer × num_hidden_layers
// × tokens, still explicitly out of scope per the design's own RunLayerLoop/RunGreedyDecodeLoop
// signature note: "separately, internally heap-allocated ... never a caller-supplied buffer of
// any kind"), RmsNormSite is a single, small, already-directly-called site this file owns the
// call to -- adding one optional parameter closes the gap without touching RunLayerLoop's own,
// much deeper, shared per-layer machinery.
//
// PrefillWholeTokens' own embed_codes is threaded the same way (round 2); `layers_scratch` (both
// call sites) stays unthreaded -- only allocated when an adapter is bound (the common no-adapter
// case makes zero allocation there already), and a std::vector<superslm::LayerWeights> is not POD
// bytes this byte-oriented workspace layout can safely describe without a much larger, riskier
// placement-new scheme; disclosed, not fixed.
//
// sslm_prefill's own remaining ~9716 allocations (EmbedEntry's own internal `wide` scratch, called
// once per prefilled token, PLUS RunLayerLoop's own internal per-layer scratch) are NOT reachable
// from this file's own workspace layout, and are NOT part of the recalibrated contract (C1b's own
// stable-count cell states the engine's own scratch cost as disclosed and data-independent, never
// a zero requirement) -- correctly, permanently out of this ABI layer's own scope per the design's
// own text quoted above.

// `s->lifecycle_mutex` dereferences already-freed memory. A registry OUTSIDE any individual
// sequence, alive for the whole process, closes this: every touch of a sequence pointer that
// could race a concurrent release -- both the decode side's liveness-check-and-lock and the
// release side's remove-then-barrier-then-delete -- goes through `g_seq_registry_mutex` first,
// so the two operations that must never interleave are themselves mutually exclusive, and a
// decode call PROVES a sequence is still live (a lookup, not a dereference) before it ever
// touches it. `static`, not a class member: process-wide is a deliberately coarser scope than
// per-model (this file's only registry of live `sslm_seq_s*` handles).
//
// T-2199 Phase D review fix S7 (Claude/Poirot/7a3b10a-t2199-phaseD-review.md): this comment
// USED TO also claim the registry section below "is held only for a lookup plus a small number
// of already-cheap mutex acquisitions, not for a call's actual forward-pass work" -- false,
// unconditionally, and the finding is right to name it as its own defect distinct from the code.
// `sslm_decode_stepImpl` holds every acquired `lifecycle_mutex` for its ENTIRE per-sequence body
// (the full forward pass, by design -- `sslm_seq_s::lifecycle_mutex`'s own comment), and that
// acquisition happens INSIDE this registry lock's own critical section (below). So when two
// concurrent batched decode calls name the same sequence, the second genuinely blocks inside the
// registry section for as long as the first's forward pass takes, while holding the one
// process-wide lock every `sslm_seq_create`/`sslm_seq_release` must also acquire -- an unrelated
// sequence's create/release can stall behind an unrelated sequence's decode. Confirmed correct
// as a claim about CORRECTNESS (proven: `sslm_seq_release` cannot slip past a decode call that
// already holds this lock) but wrong as a claim about COST, which is the part this correction
// fixes.
//
// The finding's own SUGGESTED reordering -- "prove liveness and copy the survivor list under
// the registry lock, release it, then acquire the per-sequence locks ... the sort already there
// makes that safe on its own" -- was evaluated and is NOT safe as literally stated, by a
// counter-example: release the registry lock after proving `X` live but before locking
// `X->lifecycle_mutex`; a concurrent `sslm_seq_release(X)` can then acquire the now-free registry
// lock, erase `X`, win the UNCONTENDED barrier lock on `X->lifecycle_mutex` (this decode call has
// not reached it yet), and `delete X` -- all before this decode call's own deferred lock attempt
// runs, which then dereferences freed memory. This is the SAME class of use-after-free the two
// earlier, already-failed D3 fix attempts hit (this section's own header comment, above),
// reproduced by construction rather than by execution: the per-sequence lock can only be safely
// acquired while SOME lock already prevents the object's deletion, and once the registry lock is
// released, nothing does. Closing this while ALSO shrinking the critical section's true cost
// needs a different mechanism than a reorder (e.g. a refcounted/generation-checked handle, so a
// decode call can hold a lightweight "this sequence will outlive my touch of it" token without
// holding the registry lock for its own decode work) -- a genuine design question, not fixed
// here, and NOT worked around with an unsound reorder that would reintroduce the exact crash
// class this whole D3 fix exists to close. Routed -- and RULED, not merely proposed: plan Sec9
// dim3, T-2199 fold 24 (Claude/Plans/superslm-1p2-fsd-plan-2026-08-19.md), accepts this shape as
// current-and-correct and declines the refcounted/generation-checked alternative for now (bounded,
// precisely-priced contention against an unproven redesign on a subsystem already gotten wrong
// twice) -- see the closing-round review's own N5 finding
// (Claude/Poirot/a12bbdd-t2199-phaseD-closing.md) for why this comment, not the board or the
// decision log, was previously the only place this was recorded.

//
// FOLD RULING on the third confirmation pass's F2 (Claude/Vitruvius/
// t2133-layer1-c-abi-design-2026-08-16.md Sec6, design commit dated 2026-08-17; D-SLM3462):
// this comment previously claimed `catch (const std::exception&)` meant "nothing past this point
// may propagate as a C++ exception regardless of its concrete type" -- false in both directions,
// proven by a compiled probe (F2): a throw NOT derived from `std::exception` (a custom type, or a
// non-class throw like `throw int`) crossed the boundary as real, observed undefined behavior,
// while every `std::exception` subtype that is NOT an allocation failure (`std::out_of_range`,
// `std::logic_error`, ...) was mis-attributed as SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED -- contradicting design
// Sec6's own ratified meaning for that status ("one dedicated cause (process-level exhaustion),
// never a wrapper for causes that already have their own status") and the "What this design does
// NOT add" text ("a SSLM_DEVICE_LOST-shaped catch-all"). The ruling narrows the shape to satisfy
// both constraints with one helper:
//   - `catch (const std::bad_alloc&)` and `catch (const std::length_error&)` -- the two standard
//     exceptions that mean "the requested allocation/size cannot be honored," the only causes
//     this family is defined to cover -- return SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED, unchanged.
//   - A final `catch (...)` -- the true, unconditional boundary, catching every remaining
//     exception type, INCLUDING non-`std::exception`-derived ones and non-class throws -- returns
//     SSLM_ARTIFACT_REJECTED. No new ordinal is minted: SSLM_ARTIFACT_REJECTED is the existing
//     family for "this call cannot be honored for an internal-rejection cause with no dedicated
//     status of its own," the same mapping MapForwardStatus (below, this file) already
//     establishes for every SslmForwardStatus cause this ABI's own closed taxonomy does not
//     separately enumerate, extended here to the identical `catch (...)`-boundary shape rather
//     than inventing a second mechanism for the same decision.
//
// SCOPE (FOLD RULING, second pass, D-SLM3464): the two rules above hold for THIS helper --
// `CatchAllocationFailure` itself, and every call site that goes through it (`BuildEngineCache`'s
// own wrap inside `sslm_model_map`, and every sizing/construction verb's own wrap). They do NOT
// describe `sslm_model_map`'s or `sslm_adapter_map`'s own bare `try { SslmModel::Load(...); }
// catch (...) { ... }` blocks (this file, their own definitions) -- those two are fronted by
// `SslmModel::Load`'s public entry, `internal::WrapBadAllocContract` (src/bad_alloc_wrap.h),
// which narrows every non-bad_alloc `std::exception` to `std::bad_alloc` before either of THOSE
// try/catch blocks ever runs. Their own delivered contract is narrower and documented at their
// own definitions, not here: any `std::exception`-derived internal cause -> `SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED`,
// `catch (...)` -> `SSLM_ARTIFACT_REJECTED` live only for non-`std::exception`-derived throws.
// `WrapBadAllocContract` is independently-governed S-HARDEN-7 machinery this ABI does not own and
// is ruled out of scope for a rewrite (D-SLM3464) -- see the two call sites' own comments.

// build's own S-FREEZE run measured, by execution, that a sequence resting BETWEEN
// sslm_decode_step calls (produced a token, not yet embedded the next one) cannot have its
// pending-embed token id re-derived from layer_index/context_length alone -- restore's own
// ready_for_logits path recomputed the SAME prediction already produced before saving instead
// of the live sequence's true one-token-further continuation (measured: live continues with
// 315, the pre-amendment restore produced 0). One field closes it: `current_token` (int32_t,
// `-1` sentinel = not applicable -- every OTHER resting state, fresh-post-prefill or mid-token,
// is still correctly determined from layer_index/context_length alone, so no second field is
// needed). See sslm_seq_save/sslm_seq_restore below for the exact field position and
// sslm_seq_restore's own comment for how the sentinel and the ready_for_logits fallback compose.
//
// MAGIC NOTE (design commit 9e2995f4e7's own one-time exception, cited here so the exception is
// visible at the point it is taken, not only in the design doc): 'SSB1' is amended IN PLACE for
// this one field, not bumped to a new magic. This is a stated, one-time, pre-first-ship
// exception to the standing magic-per-version law immediately below -- no 'SSB1' blob has ever
// been committed or persisted anywhere in this tree (every one produced so far is a same-run,
// uncommitted smoke/example artifact, T-2139's own build log §15), so there is no already-
// shipped consumer's stored bytes this amendment could misread. The standing law resumes with
// no further exceptions the instant this corrected 'SSB1' ships -- every subsequent field-layout
// change, including one this small, gets a new, distinct magic. A distinct magic does not by
// itself forbid a reader from supporting a shipped older layout explicitly.
//
// 'SSB2' (M4, D-SLM3486, design Sec7.3 -- the G5 blockers round's own M4, ruled): the standing
// law above IS exercised here, not re-excepted. `forced_token_count` (int64_t, `sslm_stats_out`'s
// own field, above) joins the blob -- it did not survive save/restore before this fold, silently
// resetting to 0 on every restore, which the M4 finding named and correctly declined to fix
// in-place (the current_token ruling's own closing sentence forecloses a second 'SSB1' amendment).
// Placed after `kv_saturation_count`, grouped with the other fixed-width per-sequence scalar
// counters it belongs with by kind -- Sec7.3 states plainly there is no safe-insertion-point
// constraint to respect for a genuinely new format. Restore-side validation is the blob's own
// existing size-sufficiency check only (no domain constraint narrower than "any non-negative
// int64_t", matching `current_token`'s own precedent) -- see sslm_seq_restore's own magic check,
// below, for the "reject 'SSB1' outright, never default the field" half of this ruling. SSB3's
// reader can support SSB2 because the newly absent anti-LM state has the exact empty-state default.

// itself (this file's own compiled .obj is the only definition; nothing routes a real host to
// it).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: T-2132's own zero-fill fix (DrawBlock, above) made ReturnBlock's poison-fill
// unobservable through the PRODUCTION read path -- every live sequence's own KV block is reached
// via DrawBlock, which now zero-fills unconditionally, so ANY dimension-1 leak-check cell that
// reads a block through a live sequence handle passes whether or not ReturnBlock ever poisoned
// anything at all (Poirot's own finding: "the guard is now one that cannot fail"). The leak
// obligation itself (Sec7 dim1: "no content from the PRIOR sequence survives release") did not
// get weaker -- it got STRONGER, structurally guaranteed by the zero-fill rather than merely
// detectable against a poison pattern -- but a guard that structurally cannot fail is also a
// guard nothing can exercise, and Poirot's own remedy (S4) asks for a discriminating mechanism to
// be restored or the claim to be honestly retired.
//
// THE MECHANISM: reads `n` raw bytes directly from `pool`'s own backing buffer at `block_index`,
// BYPASSING DrawBlock entirely -- the one read path in this whole file that does NOT run through
// the zero-fill. A test can therefore: draw a block, write real content into it (a real decode),
// release it (ReturnBlock's own poison-fill runs), then peek the SAME block_index through THIS
// hook BEFORE drawing it again -- proving the poison-fill actually ran (0xCD observed) rather
// than merely trusting the source. This restores exactly the discrimination S4 asks for: DELETE
// ReturnBlock's own `std::memset(kv_block, 0xCD, block_size)` line and this peek would read
// whatever ReturnBlock's caller left behind instead of 0xCD -- a real, demonstrated failure mode
// for the pin built against this hook (tools/t2132_s4_leak_guard_mutation_pin.cpp), not an
// assertion that cannot be tripped. Bounds-checked against `pool->buf_size`/`block_count` --
