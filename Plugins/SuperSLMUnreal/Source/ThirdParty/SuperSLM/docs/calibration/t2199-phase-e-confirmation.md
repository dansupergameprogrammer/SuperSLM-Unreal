# T-2199 Phase E end-to-end confirmation

**Result: damped greedy works as an opt-in anti-loop decoder at the ruled operating point. Greedy remains the default.**

Operating point: `alpha=2`, `n=2`, `k=6`, `alpha_q15=65536`, `q=(493, 964, 487361)`.

`cap/EOS` reports generations that reached the token ceiling / emitted a stop token.

The original Phase E arms were captured in separate runs and produced different generation
lengths. Their raw timings remain in the JSON evidence, but the resulting 1.112x–1.233x
per-cell and 1.225x–1.285x per-token ratios are not valid decoder-cost measurements and are not
published as such.

The release-candidate follow-up fixes the workload: the same DGC1 artifact, prompt, executable,
and exactly 30 generated tokens, with arm order alternating across six pairs. Greedy averaged
4.276667 seconds and damped greedy 4.277000 seconds, a 1.000078x ratio; the 0.333 ms mean
difference is below the CLI timer's 1 ms reporting resolution. The real 0.5B Phase D2a run put
the complete allocation-free selector at 0.2453%–0.2461% of one forward step. Evidence:
[`t2199-controlled-cost.json`](t2199-controlled-cost.json).

Production matched the B0 replay reach and locked-row ceiling in all four cells. The two 100-token cells were rerun after the ruling and matched their B0 token streams exactly: 0 mismatches across 96 generations. Greedy capture independently matched the frozen T-2193 baseline in all 192 model/length/prompt cases.

## Fidelity interpretation

The result supports the ruled product shape, not semantic equivalence. Damped greedy removes the measured loop locks and often improves prose, but it can alter facts, structure, count, formatting, and termination. In particular, `list_primed_00` demonstrates that legitimate repeated list syntax is penalized along with pathological repetition. Format-sensitive calls should use greedy or schema-constrained decoding unless the caller explicitly chooses this tradeoff.

## Real text, side by side (300-token cells)

The three known 0.5B lock cases come first, followed by fixed narration, flavor, and list cases. Text is decoded from the recorded token streams.

Greedy:

<pre>In the heart of the bustling city, where the vibrant hues of the neon lights danced against the backdrop of towering skyscrapers, there was a unique item that captivated the hearts of adventurers and traders alike. It was a small, cylindrical vessel, its sleek design and smooth, metallic surface a striking contrast to the rough, rugged exterior of the city. This item was more than just a drink; it was a symbol of strength and power, a potent blend of the city&#x27;s energy, ensuring that those who drank it would not only survive but thrive in the city&#x27;s bustling environment. The drink was not just for the thirsty, but for the well-fed, for the city&#x27;s inhabitants who sought to sustain their strength and endurance. It was a tangible embodiment of the city&#x27;s spirit, a reminder of the city&#x27;s energy and the importance of it to those who lived in it.</pre>

Damped greedy:

<pre>In the heart of the bustling city, where the vibrant hues of red and gold danced across the streets, stood a shop that housed not just a store but a sanctuary for the weary traveler. This was the &quot;Tattoo Shop,&quot; where artists and enthusiasts alike sought to enhance their beauty with the power of tattoos.

In its backroom, the shop&#x27;s most prized item was a sleek, cylindrical container adorned with intricate patterns. The interior was adorned in vibrant colors, with shelves filled with vibrant, shimmering gemstones. Among these, a particular item stood out—a small, sleek bottle of what appeared to be a potent, amber-colored liquid.

The item&#x27;s name was &quot;Steady Hands Energy Drink.&quot; Its distinctive design was a blend of a traditional tattoo ink with a blendable, energizing essence. The drink was crafted to provide a temporary boost to the wearer&#x27;s energy, much like a quick burst of energy in a game.

This drink, though not a traditional one, was designed to be taken in pill form, which was why it was often sold in bulk. Its use was limited to its intended users, who sought it to rejuvenate their spirits and keep them energized. It was not meant to be consumed in any way, but rather consumed through the drink itself.

In the shop, customers would often be seen standing in front of the bottle, their faces a mix of excitement and perhaps a touch of nervousness. They would sip the drink, their eyes fixed on the</pre>

The door creaks open, and a soft murmur of excited chatter fills the air. A group of young apprentices, each with a tattoo in mind, rush in, their eyes wide with excitement. They rush to the back, where the master tattooist, a gentle and wise woman named Elara, is already hard at work.

&quot;Good morning, everyone!&quot; Elara&#x27;s voice crackles through the door, her tone filled with warmth and welcome. &quot;We&#x27;re just getting started, but I can already feel the energy in the air. It&#x27;s going to be a busy day!&quot;

The apprentices cheer, their hands already in the air, ready to dive into their work. They rush to the waiting clients, each one eager to have their own unique piece of art. The first client, a young artist named Lila, is already in the waiting room, her eyes wide with wonder.
