"""T-2380 (Curie) -- the red suite for the archive-based ship gate's own
reader, classifier, and Mach-O-disposition stages: design Sec4.1/Sec5.4/
Sec5.5/Sec7 dimension 11's thirty-seventh through forty-sixth populations,
as amended by fold round 42
(Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-superslm-fp-free-open-design-2026-08-24.md), plus
the fold-42 correction to `scan_object`'s own printed signature (D-SLM5071).

Companion file `test_archive_composition.py` carries the composition-stage
populations (forty-seventh, corrected, and forty-eighth) -- this split
mirrors the design's own four-stage partition (Sec4.1's fourth law):
membership/reading/classification live here, composition lives there.

BUILT (T-2381, Brunel, 2026-08-28): `check_fp_free_scan.py` now has
`iterate_archive_members`, `enumerate_archive_objects`,
`MalformedArchiveError`, and `ArchiveHasNoObjectsError`, and `scan_object`'s
own signature carries both `corpus_symbols` and `data`
(`(path: str, isa: str, corpus_symbols: frozenset | None = None, data:
bytes | None = None) -> ScanResult`). Every `xfail(strict=True)` cell this
file originally carried has been removed by Brunel's build round, per this
suite's own stated gate ("the day a cell starts passing unexpectedly,
strict=True turns it into a reported failure, which is the signal to remove
that cell's own marker") -- every cell below is now a real, currently-
enforced regression guard, none an absent-instrument placeholder.

RESOLVING POWER is stated in each population's own docstring, per design
Sec4.1's resolving-power clause (D-SLM5066): the smallest unit-count change
the population's own cells are built to separate. Most cells here resolve
membership/classification at the finest available grain (one member, one
mnemonic); nothing in this file tests the composition stage's own
resolving power over the full 1..18 position sweep -- that is
test_archive_composition.py's own subject.

    indirect memory, RIP-relative) -- capstone 5.0.7 (this repo's own
    pinned version, matching check_fp_free_scan.py's own decoder) renders
    every one as a bare "jmp"/"call" mnemonic with NO "data16" text, because
    check_fp_free_scan.py's own decoder never inspects capstone's prefix
    detail, only `insn.mnemonic`. This claim is not reproducible by
    execution against the pinned capstone version and is NOT asserted
