"""T-2333/T-2326 (Curie) -- red suite for design Sec4.1's deciding instrument:
an instruction-level, byte-accounting, default-deny scan over compiled
machine code, which does not exist yet anywhere in this tree.

SOURCE ARTIFACT. `Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-superslm-fp-free-open-design-2026-08-24.md`
Sec4.1 (the mechanism and its now-RATIFIED production interface) and Sec7
dimension 11 (the fourteen commissioning populations this suite realizes), as
the design stands through fold round 33. This campaign's own test-design
records: `Claude/Curie/t2326-fp-scan-instrument-red-suite-2026-08-27.md`
(original 23-cell suite, contract proposed) and
`Claude/Curie/t2333-fp-scan-instrument-red-suite-ratified-2026-08-27.md`
(this ticket's own repointing to the ratified contract).

WHY EVERY TEST HERE FAILS TODAY, AND WILL CONTINUE TO FAIL UNTIL BRUNEL BUILDS
THE INSTRUMENT. Sec4.1 specifies a Python CI tool -- a byte-level decoder
(capstone-driven, per-ISA), a closed-symbol-table membership rule, three
default-deny checks (A: register-file, B: GPR/control-flow allowlist, C: call/
jmp target allowlist), and a REFUSE control action on any unaccounted byte --
wired into this repo's own tests/ci/check_<name>.py + test_check_<name>.py
convention (tests/ci/check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py and its own test file are
the precedent this suite matches). None of that production module exists.
This file assumes it will be built at tests/ci/check_fp_free_scan.py (added
to sys.path below relative to this file, since this suite itself lives under
tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/ per this ticket's own writable-scope
constraint, not tests/ci/). Every population test below:

  1. Builds its own fixture FRESH (never a committed binary), using
     fp_scan_common.py's own toolchain wrappers. A toolchain genuinely absent
     from this environment SKIPs that one cell -- none did this session;
     every toolchain fired (see the case file's own toolchain table).
  2. Independently verifies, via a raw capstone decode or a narrow disasm-text
     parse -- NOT the (absent) instrument's own logic -- that the fixture
     genuinely carries the byte-level property its own population claims.
     This half is real, executed, and independent of whether the instrument
     exists.
  3. THEN calls the (absent) production module and asserts its documented
     verdict, from WITHIN the same fixture's own scope. This is the genuinely
     red half, today, for exactly one reason: importing check_fp_free_scan
     fails.

THE RATIFIED CONTRACT for tests/ci/check_fp_free_scan.py (design
Sec4.1, fold rounds 31/32/33; D-SLM4826/D-SLM4827/D-SLM4830/D-SLM4834 --
superseding T-2326's own proposed contract, D-SLM4825, which this file no
longer asserts as current):

    scan_object(path: str, isa: str) -> ScanResult

        isa in {"x86-64", "aarch64"} -- a build-time input the CI leg
        declares, never inferred from the object.

    ScanResult:
        .object_format: str          -- "coff" | "elf", READ from the
                                         object's own header -- NEVER a
                                         caller-supplied parameter (the one
                                         correction fold round 31 made to
                                         T-2326's own proposal: T-2326 carried
                                         object_format as a peer parameter to
                                         isa; every executed probe this design
                                         has run reads it from the object's
                                         own header instead, and a caller-
                                         supplied label could drift from what
                                         the file actually is).
        .refuse: bool                -- clause (0)'s own REFUSE.
        .unclassified_bytes: int
        .verdicts: dict[str, str]    -- symbol -> "ACCEPT" | "REJECT"; EMPTY
                                         when .refuse (guarantee (i)).

    ci_gate(result: ScanResult, expected_symbols: Sequence[str]) -> bool

        expected_symbols is derived from the OBJECT'S OWN symbol table, never
        from result.verdicts. Enforces: (i) result.refuse implies
        result.verdicts == {}; (ii) the caller's own process exits nonzero
        whenever this returns False for any leg; (iii) any name in
        expected_symbols absent from result.verdicts, when NOT refused, fails
        independently -- the absent-report leg.

    enumerate_scan_targets() -> list[tuple[str, str]]

        (translation_unit_name, compiled_object_path) pairs, derived from
        SUPERSLM_CORE_SOURCES at scan time -- the production membership's own
        node-set derivation.

    diagnostic_walk(roots: Sequence[str], call_graph: Mapping[str, set[str]]) -> set[str]

        Breadth/depth-first transitive closure from roots over call_graph's
        own edges. Population five's own discharge: compile the chain, build
        the real call graph, assert the deepest member is reachable.

    derive_core_sources(manifest_path: str = "CMakeLists.txt") -> list[str]

        Parses SUPERSLM_CORE_SOURCES out of the named manifest -- the shared
        TU-list primitive enumerate_scan_targets, build_call_graph, and
        flagged_symbols all call internally. Specified fold round 32
        (D-SLM4830) as population six's own occupant; CORRECTED fold round 33
        (D-SLM4834): this function alone does NOT discharge population six --
        it parses a manifest into a TU-name list and never compiles,
        disassembles, or detects anything, so it cannot carry population
        six's own end-to-end claim (a genuine derivation REPORTS a flagged
        instruction in a newly-added TU; a stale enumeration SILENTLY MISSES
        it). It remains a real, sound sub-component of population five's own
        discharge and of enumerate_scan_targets.

    build_call_graph(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str) -> Mapping[str, set[str]]
    flagged_symbols(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str) -> Mapping[str, list[str]]
    diagnostic_fp_report(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str,
                          roots: Sequence[str]) -> Mapping[str, list[str]]

        Population six's real occupant, specified fold round 33 (D-SLM4834).
        Both build_call_graph and flagged_symbols derive their own TU
        enumeration from derive_core_sources(manifest_path) internally --
        never a caller-supplied source list -- and read each derived TU's own
        real disassembly text from disasm_dir. diagnostic_fp_report combines
        them: every symbol reachable from roots via
        diagnostic_walk(roots, build_call_graph(...)) that also has a
        non-empty entry in flagged_symbols(...). A call instruction names its
        target by symbol whether or not the target's own TU was ever read, so
        build_call_graph alone (population five's own surface) cannot
        distinguish a genuine derivation from a stale one -- only the
        combined report can, because a symbol's own content is scanned ONLY
        if its defining TU was actually read.

THIS FILE DOES NOT CITE, IMPORT, OR RELY ON Claude/Vitruvius/
t2265-fold32-probe/class_closure_check.py OR DESIGN Sec2.9's OWN VERDICTS.
Sec2.9's claim-shadow test is QUARANTINED (D-SLM4833) -- its own validation
population and its shadow-parameter field are each proven insufficient by a
named, executed finding, and the design's own text states its verdicts are
"recorded, never cited as evidence for any gate decision" until independently
commissioned (tracked at T-2337, which does not gate this design). Population
six's own correction is established here the same way the design's own text
establishes it: by an independent, directly executed probe
(Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-fold33-probe/population6_end_to_end_probe.py), never
by running Sec2.9's own check against a corrected row.

    legitimate vp-prefixed packed-integer VNNI dot-product family --
    vpdpbusd/vpdpwssd -- which the same rule correctly accepts). A cell that
    pins one spelling pins nothing about the other.

    DISCLOSED LIMITATION, confirmed by direct execution this session: capstone

    -mavx512bf16 compile of the real intrinsics produces an object whose BF16
    instruction capstone's own disasm() stops before, exactly the "decoder
    gap" Popper's own commissioning independently found: "the AVX-512 FP16/
    BF16 probe refused at the decoder before reaching the classifier"). This
    cell therefore calls the classifier function directly with both literal

    `_x86_check_a('vpdpbf16ps', ...)` call) -- rather than a real compiled
    object, and states this as a deliberate, disclosed scope limit, not a
    silent substitution.

    T-2403 (Curie), R4's own companion pin (`Claude/Vitruvius/
    t2265-fold46-delta-manifest.md` Sec2/Sec5; D-SLM5166): once
    _x86_check_a's contract changes from bool to Optional[str] (R4,
    population fifty-two above), 'vpdpbusd' ACCEPTs by returning the string
    'p_vp_structural_allow' rather than the literal True, and the two BF16
    rejects become None rather than the literal False -- the three
    assertions below would break under an `is True`/`is False` identity
    check the moment R4 lands, landing this cell's own regression exactly
    where the project's standing rule says a production remedy's test pin
    belongs: routed in the SAME round as the change it pins, not
    discovered after. Written in truthiness form (bool(...) is True/False)
    now, ahead of R4, so this cell reads identically under both the

    name (`StandardsDocument.md` Sec6.6: HEAD holds only current truth).

    ORIGINAL CLAIM (fold round 35, D-SLM4889): `vxorps xmm0, xmm1, xmm0` --
    one operand differs -- is "genuine bitwise arithmetic, not the
    self-zeroing idiom," and must REJECT. This was correct against the
    pre-fold-39 classifier (the self-zeroing carve-out is the ONLY path by
    which xorps/vxorps could ever ACCEPT), but fold round 39's own D-SLM4987
    ruling reverses it: "orps, orpd, andps, andpd, andnps, andnpd, xorps,
    xorpd, vorps, vorpd, vandps, vandpd, vandnps, vandnpd, vxorps, vxorpd
    perform no floating-point arithmetic and are accepted unconditionally,
    ON ANY OPERAND LIST" (design Sec4.1) -- vxorps is explicitly one of the
    eight named mnemonics, and the design's own text states the reasoning
    generally: "any operand list that is not uniformly the same register
    remains a genuine bitwise operation" is a correct CLASSIFICATION
    (bitwise, not arithmetic) that this population's own pre-fold-39 text
    paired with the wrong VERDICT (reject a bitwise operation). T-2364's
    strike (Finding 1) and T-2365's coverage audit (Finding 1) both found
    this exact collision independently, blind to each other, against the
    identical instruction: population 16's own committed must-reject
    construction asserts the opposite of what D-SLM4987 requires.

    RESOLUTION PINNED HERE, per T-2365's own routing (Sec7, "Bare cell --
    population 16's own must-reject construction, reconciled against
    D-SLM4987"): option (a) -- retract the must-reject reading and assert
    must-accept instead, since the design's current text supports only (a)

    own unconditional, any-operand-list ruling for this eight-mnemonic
    family). T-2367 landed check (A)'s D-SLM4987 widening; confirmed by
    direct execution this session, the shipped classifier now ACCEPTs this
    construction and the assertion below passes, for the same reason it

# deny-list of floating-point mnemonics on the grounds that they are "an
# allow-list ... fail-closed on an unknown mnemonic." Conductor-executed
# against capstone's own x86-64 vocabulary at engine a1df129 (D-SLM4999):
# check (A) accepts a majority of its own vector-operand ACCEPTs via a
# structural rule ("starts with p or vp") guarded only by a 6-entry deny
# list, `_X86_P_PREFIX_EXCLUDE` -- named by no allow-list at all, and
# fail-OPEN rather than fail-closed on anything the deny list does not name.
# The rule's premise (a p/vp prefix means packed-integer by construction)
# has already been falsified twice: the 3DNow pi2f* family and the BF16
# dot-product/convert family, each patched into the deny list reactively
# after it leaked into the shipped classifier.
#
# REPRODUCTION NOTE, per this ticket's own instruction to reproduce the
# cited figures before pinning any of them: D-SLM4999 states 1523/539/481/58;
# T-2364's own probe (`Claude/Loki/t2364-probe/p02_mnemonic_census.py`)
# computes 1523/539/428/111, using a "named" set that includes
# `_X86_GPR_ALLOW` -- a list check (B), not check (A), consults, and which
# check (A) never reads on ANY branch, vector-operand or not. Reproduced
# independently, twice, this session (T-2366), using ONLY the allow-list
# check (A) itself actually consults for a vector-touching instruction
# (`_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW`; the self-zeroing xorps/vxorps family contributed
# zero additional members under a differing-operand probe at that time,
# since it never matched a differing-operand construction): 1523
# vocabulary, 539 accepted by check (A) on a vector operand, of which 438
# passed ONLY the structural rule and 101 were named by
# `_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW` explicitly. Neither D-SLM4999's 481/58 nor T-2364's
# 428/111 reproduced against the classifier actually consulted; 438/101 was
# pinned as the reproduced figure, and the discrepancy was filed per
# `StandardsDocument.md` Sec5.4 (a ruling contradicted by measurement is
# reopened, not defended) rather than silently pinning either prior,
# unreproduced number.
#
# T-2368 (Curie), D-SLM5009a: T-2367's build round widened check (A)'s
# bitwise-family boundary per D-SLM4987 -- `orps`/`orpd`/`andps`/`andpd`/
# `andnps`/`andnpd`/`xorps`/`xorpd` and their eight VEX forms, all sixteen
# now ACCEPT unconditionally. Re-derived fresh this session (not copied from
# any prior entry): the sixteen are ADDITIONAL structural-only accepts --
# none is named by `_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW` -- so `accept_a` moves 539 -> 555
# and `structural_only` moves 438 -> 454; `named_accept` (101) is
# unaffected. The qualitative finding -- a majority of check (A)'s
# vector-operand accepts rely on the deny-list-guarded structural rule
# alone, not an allow-list -- is unchanged and is what the cell below
# checks: a design that claims "never a deny-list ... fail-closed on any
# mnemonic neither check names" is false while this count is nonzero.

# CLOSURE NOTE (T-2404/T-2407): every paragraph above describes the

# (D-SLM5009). D-SLM5155/D-SLM5156 (Dan, 2026-08-29) closed that question:
# `_X86_P_VP_STRUCTURAL_ALLOW` (R3, T-2404) replaces the deny-list-guarded
# structural rule with a frozen allow-list, and check (A)'s p/vp branch is
# fail-closed as of that commit, not fail-open. The counts this block

    against fp_scan_fixtures/p_vp_structural_only_pinned.txt.

    Deliberately NOT an attempt to classify which members are "genuinely
    floating point": D-SLM5009b files that classification as open, waiting
    on Dan, bounded but not small, and not this ticket's to build --  and
    this suite's own narrow, test-local `_is_x86_fp_arith` (confirmed this
    session to misclassify the real packed-integer mnemonics `pmaxsd`/
    `pminsd`/`vpcmpd`/`vpmaxsd`/`vpminsd` as floating-point-shaped, because
    their `sd`/`d` suffix is an integer element-size code that coincides

    run over the whole real vocabulary -- doing so produces false "FP"
    positives on ordinary packed-integer instructions, which would make
    this cell red for the wrong reason.

    A membership pin needs no such classifier: a REMOVED member -- capstone
    renaming or retiring a mnemonic already admitted onto the frozen
    allow-list -- is exactly the observable signal D-SLM4999's residual
    concern needs from THIS cell, and needs no confirmed-FP classification

    D-SLM5156's own freeze (R3, T-2404) forecloses this cell's other half.
    `_x86_check_a`'s p/vp branch now consults `_X86_P_VP_STRUCTURAL_ALLOW`
    alone, so a brand-new p/vp mnemonic capstone starts recognizing is, by
    construction, absent from that frozen list -- it REJECTs and never
    enters `accept_a`, so it never enters `structural_only` either. This
    cell alone can no longer see a member ADDED to the set the way it once
    did (when the pre-freeze rule accepted anything not on a 6-entry deny
    list, a genuinely new mnemonic joined `structural_only` automatically).
    The added-member half of "any change to this set" is restored by the
    sibling cell below,
    `test_check_a_p_vp_naming_convention_vocabulary_is_pinned_against_growth`,
    which watches the raw p/vp naming-convention vocabulary instead of
    this post-decision accept set, so a new mnemonic changes what THAT
    cell sees the moment capstone starts emitting it, REJECT or not.

    On failure here, a removed member means capstone renamed or retired a
    mnemonic already admitted onto the frozen allow-list -- raise it; the
    fixture is not silently regenerated. (The `added` branch below is kept
    rather than deleted: it still fires, safely, if `_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW`
    ever shrinks and reclassifies an existing accept into
    `structural_only` -- it is only a brand-new capstone mnemonic that
    this cell can no longer see arrive.)

# T-2366 (Curie), D-SLM5001 item (3) -- D-SLM4359's seven switch-jump-table
# symbols. D-SLM4359 ruled all seven restructured to direct conditional
# branches before v1.3.0 ships. D-SLM4988 (fold round 39) narrowed the
# GATING half of that ruling to only the two that REFUSE
# (?ExpectedDtype/?IsKnownSectionType), on the premise that the other five
# -- which reject via check (C) alone -- no longer block the gate once check
# (C) stops gating. T-2364's strike (blast radius item 2) found that premise
# void against the driver as it stood then: the shipped driver's own
# verdict still read check (C), so all five still REJECTed through it,
# unconditionally. T-2367 (fold round 39) built the premise's own
# precondition -- the driver now decides on `ab_verdicts` (checks (A)/(B)

    Re-aimed (T-2389 item 2, Poirot 8788b01 N6): the second leg used to
    assert that an existing but empty `<target>.dir` exits 2 "(zero
    objects found)". `main()` no longer enumerates `<target>.dir` at all
    -- the archive is the only corpus (D-SLM5100/D-SLM5101) -- so it
    reaches `find_target_archive`, finds no candidate, and exits 2 via
    the identical missing-archive path a NONEXISTENT build directory
    takes. An empty `<target>.dir` therefore graded nothing about object
    count; it duplicated the first leg under a different label.

    Re-aimed at what the driver actually discriminates: a `<target>.dir`
    carrying a REAL compiled object, still with no archive at any
    candidate path. This is the design's own "THE ARCHIVE IS THE ONLY
    CORPUS -- NO FALLBACK" claim, not yet pinned anywhere else in this

    restored fortieth population, D-SLM5103) but no cell exercises a
    populated object directory against a missing archive. Able to fail

    monkeypatching `find_target_archive` so it fabricates a hit (any real,
    well-formed archive elsewhere on disk) for this exact populated,
    archive-less build directory turns the exit code from 2 to 0 (PASS),
    and the assertion below catches it. (A literal object-directory
    fallback that mis-encodes the raw `.obj` itself as an archive is
    instead caught one step later, by the malformed-archive check --
    still exit 2, but for a different reason; the fabricated-hit mutation
    isolates the property this leg actually pins: exit code 2 depends on
    the archive genuinely being absent from every candidate location, not

# correction (`Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-fold46-delta-manifest.md` Sec2's own
# R4 entry via Sec5's execution ledger; design Sec7 dimension 11's
# fifty-second population, D-SLM5157). `_x86_check_a`'s contract changes
# from bool to Optional[str] (the admitting branch's own name, or None on
# REJECT); structural_only is redefined as every acceptance with no
# reported reason (not isinstance(reason, str) -- D-SLM5165 proved the
# literal 'reason is None' reading dead: accept_a is already filtered to
# acceptances, so nothing inside it can satisfy that predicate and the
# census reports zero on the mutant it exists to catch).
#
# Both cells below need R4's contract change to exist: the must-accept
# fails naturally today (every accept returns bool True, not a reason
# string, so structural_only == accept_a, nonempty); the must-reject is a
# mutation on the contract itself and is guarded explicitly until R4 lands.
