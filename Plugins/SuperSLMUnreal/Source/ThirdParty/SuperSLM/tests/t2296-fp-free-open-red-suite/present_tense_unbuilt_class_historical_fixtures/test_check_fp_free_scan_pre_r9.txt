"""T-2333/T-2326 (Curie) -- red suite for design Sec4.1's deciding instrument:
an instruction-level, byte-accounting, default-deny scan over compiled
machine code, which does not exist yet anywhere in this tree.

SOURCE ARTIFACT. `Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-superslm-fp-free-open-design-2026-08-24.md`
Sec4.1 (the mechanism and its now-RATIFIED production interface) and Sec7
dimension 11 (the fourteen commissioning populations this suite realizes), as
the design stands through fold round 33. This campaign's own test-design
records: `Claude/Curie/t2326-fp-scan-instrument-red-suite-2026-08-27.md`
(original 23-cell suite, contract proposed) and
`Claude/Curie/t2333-fp-scan-instrument-red-suite-ratified-2026-08-27.md`
(this ticket's own repointing to the ratified contract).

WHY EVERY TEST HERE FAILS TODAY, AND WILL CONTINUE TO FAIL UNTIL BRUNEL BUILDS
THE INSTRUMENT. Sec4.1 specifies a Python CI tool -- a byte-level decoder
(capstone-driven, per-ISA), a closed-symbol-table membership rule, three
default-deny checks (A: register-file, B: GPR/control-flow allowlist, C: call/
jmp target allowlist), and a REFUSE control action on any unaccounted byte --
wired into this repo's own tests/ci/check_<name>.py + test_check_<name>.py
convention (tests/ci/check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py and its own test file are
the precedent this suite matches). None of that production module exists.
This file assumes it will be built at tests/ci/check_fp_free_scan.py (added
to sys.path below relative to this file, since this suite itself lives under
tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/ per this ticket's own writable-scope
constraint, not tests/ci/). Every population test below:

  1. Builds its own fixture FRESH (never a committed binary), using
     fp_scan_common.py's own toolchain wrappers. A toolchain genuinely absent
     from this environment SKIPs that one cell -- none did this session;
     every toolchain fired (see the case file's own toolchain table).
  2. Independently verifies, via a raw capstone decode or a narrow disasm-text
     parse -- NOT the (absent) instrument's own logic -- that the fixture
     genuinely carries the byte-level property its own population claims.
     This half is real, executed, and independent of whether the instrument
     exists.
  3. THEN calls the (absent) production module and asserts its documented
     verdict, from WITHIN the same fixture's own scope. This is the genuinely
     red half, today, for exactly one reason: importing check_fp_free_scan
     fails.

THE RATIFIED CONTRACT for tests/ci/check_fp_free_scan.py (design
Sec4.1, fold rounds 31/32/33; D-SLM4826/D-SLM4827/D-SLM4830/D-SLM4834 --
superseding T-2326's own proposed contract, D-SLM4825, which this file no
longer asserts as current):

    scan_object(path: str, isa: str) -> ScanResult

        isa in {"x86-64", "aarch64"} -- a build-time input the CI leg
        declares, never inferred from the object.

    ScanResult:
        .object_format: str          -- "coff" | "elf", READ from the
                                         object's own header -- NEVER a
                                         caller-supplied parameter (the one
                                         correction fold round 31 made to
                                         T-2326's own proposal: T-2326 carried
                                         object_format as a peer parameter to
                                         isa; every executed probe this design
                                         has run reads it from the object's
                                         own header instead, and a caller-
                                         supplied label could drift from what
                                         the file actually is).
        .refuse: bool                -- clause (0)'s own REFUSE.
        .unclassified_bytes: int
        .verdicts: dict[str, str]    -- symbol -> "ACCEPT" | "REJECT"; EMPTY
                                         when .refuse (guarantee (i)).

    ci_gate(result: ScanResult, expected_symbols: Sequence[str]) -> bool

        expected_symbols is derived from the OBJECT'S OWN symbol table, never
        from result.verdicts. Enforces: (i) result.refuse implies
        result.verdicts == {}; (ii) the caller's own process exits nonzero
        whenever this returns False for any leg; (iii) any name in
        expected_symbols absent from result.verdicts, when NOT refused, fails
        independently -- the absent-report leg.

    enumerate_scan_targets() -> list[tuple[str, str]]

        (translation_unit_name, compiled_object_path) pairs, derived from
        SUPERSLM_CORE_SOURCES at scan time -- the production membership's own
        node-set derivation.

    diagnostic_walk(roots: Sequence[str], call_graph: Mapping[str, set[str]]) -> set[str]

        Breadth/depth-first transitive closure from roots over call_graph's
        own edges. Population five's own discharge: compile the chain, build
        the real call graph, assert the deepest member is reachable.

    derive_core_sources(manifest_path: str = "CMakeLists.txt") -> list[str]

        Parses SUPERSLM_CORE_SOURCES out of the named manifest -- the shared
        TU-list primitive enumerate_scan_targets, build_call_graph, and
        flagged_symbols all call internally. Specified fold round 32
        (D-SLM4830) as population six's own occupant; CORRECTED fold round 33
        (D-SLM4834): this function alone does NOT discharge population six --
        it parses a manifest into a TU-name list and never compiles,
        disassembles, or detects anything, so it cannot carry population
        six's own end-to-end claim (a genuine derivation REPORTS a flagged
        instruction in a newly-added TU; a stale enumeration SILENTLY MISSES
        it). It remains a real, sound sub-component of population five's own
        discharge and of enumerate_scan_targets.

    build_call_graph(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str) -> Mapping[str, set[str]]
    flagged_symbols(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str) -> Mapping[str, list[str]]
    diagnostic_fp_report(manifest_path: str, disasm_dir: str,
                          roots: Sequence[str]) -> Mapping[str, list[str]]

        Population six's real occupant, specified fold round 33 (D-SLM4834).
        Both build_call_graph and flagged_symbols derive their own TU
        enumeration from derive_core_sources(manifest_path) internally --
        never a caller-supplied source list -- and read each derived TU's own
        real disassembly text from disasm_dir. diagnostic_fp_report combines
        them: every symbol reachable from roots via
        diagnostic_walk(roots, build_call_graph(...)) that also has a
        non-empty entry in flagged_symbols(...). A call instruction names its
        target by symbol whether or not the target's own TU was ever read, so
        build_call_graph alone (population five's own surface) cannot
        distinguish a genuine derivation from a stale one -- only the
        combined report can, because a symbol's own content is scanned ONLY
        if its defining TU was actually read.

THIS FILE DOES NOT CITE, IMPORT, OR RELY ON Claude/Vitruvius/
t2265-fold32-probe/class_closure_check.py OR DESIGN Sec2.9's OWN VERDICTS.
Sec2.9's claim-shadow test is QUARANTINED (D-SLM4833) -- its own validation
population and its shadow-parameter field are each proven insufficient by a
named, executed finding, and the design's own text states its verdicts are
"recorded, never cited as evidence for any gate decision" until independently
commissioned (tracked at T-2337, which does not gate this design). Population
six's own correction is established here the same way the design's own text
establishes it: by an independent, directly executed probe
(Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-fold33-probe/population6_end_to_end_probe.py), never
by running Sec2.9's own check against a corrected row.

vacuous-True closure (D-SLM4888, two cells, test_ci_gate_corpus_vacuous_*/

8a28460-t2344 casebook routes to the test author rather than the build round:
M4 (fp_scan_common.compile_cl_release's own hardcoded flag duplication --
FIXED in place this ticket, since fp_scan_common.py is this suite's own test
helper, not production code -- see _production_flags()), O4 (populations
eight and ten migrated to xfail(strict=True), Poirot's own recommended
structural fix for build.bat's own fragile --deselect guard, S5), and O5
(run_fp_free_scan_real_corpus._msvc_target_flags's silent truncation on an

T-2366 (Curie), D-SLM5001 -- the red suite for fold round 39's acceptance form
(design Sec4.1/Sec5.4/Sec5.5/Sec7 dim 11, as amended by fold round 39,
D-SLM4981/D-SLM4984-D-SLM4990), routed by two blind, concurrently-dispatched
gates that reached the same core defect independently: T-2364's adversary
strike (`Claude/Loki/t2364-fold39-acceptance-form-strike-2026-08-28.md`,
FRACTURED, 9 of 28 claims) and T-2365's coverage audit
(`Claude/Mendeleev/t2365-fold39-dim11-coverage-audit-2026-08-28.md`, GAPS
NAMED, three Structural findings). Both found that fold round 39 wrote four
specification acts as though built when only one design-level correction
(D-SLM4987, check (A)'s bitwise-family widening) is even routed to a build
round -- the other three (the gate's own check-(C) exclusion, D-SLM4988's
REFUSE-scope narrowing, and the CI wiring) do not exist as executable code
anywhere in this tree. Six new cell groups, filed at the end of this file

    name (`StandardsDocument.md` Sec6.6: HEAD holds only current truth).

    ORIGINAL CLAIM (fold round 35, D-SLM4889): `vxorps xmm0, xmm1, xmm0` --
    one operand differs -- is "genuine bitwise arithmetic, not the
    self-zeroing idiom," and must REJECT. This was correct against the

    which xorps/vxorps could ever ACCEPT), but fold round 39's own D-SLM4987
    ruling reverses it: "orps, orpd, andps, andpd, andnps, andnpd, xorps,
    xorpd, vorps, vorpd, vandps, vandpd, vandnps, vandnpd, vxorps, vxorpd
    perform no floating-point arithmetic and are accepted unconditionally,
    ON ANY OPERAND LIST" (design Sec4.1) -- vxorps is explicitly one of the
    eight named mnemonics, and the design's own text states the reasoning
    generally: "any operand list that is not uniformly the same register
    remains a genuine bitwise operation" is a correct CLASSIFICATION
    (bitwise, not arithmetic) that this population's own pre-fold-39 text
    paired with the wrong VERDICT (reject a bitwise operation). T-2364's
    strike (Finding 1) and T-2365's coverage audit (Finding 1) both found
    this exact collision independently, blind to each other, against the
    identical instruction: population 16's own committed must-reject
    construction asserts the opposite of what D-SLM4987 requires.

    RESOLUTION PINNED HERE, per T-2365's own routing (Sec7, "Bare cell --
    population 16's own must-reject construction, reconciled against
    D-SLM4987"): option (a) -- retract the must-reject reading and assert
    must-accept instead, since the design's current text supports only (a)

    own unconditional, any-operand-list ruling for this eight-mnemonic
    family). T-2367 landed check (A)'s D-SLM4987 widening; confirmed by
    direct execution this session, the shipped classifier now ACCEPTs this
    construction and the assertion below passes, for the same reason it
    was genuinely red before that widening landed -- never from a broken

# list, `_X86_P_PREFIX_EXCLUDE` -- named by no allow-list at all, and
# fail-OPEN rather than fail-closed on anything the deny list does not name.
# The rule's premise (a p/vp prefix means packed-integer by construction)

# dot-product/convert family, each patched into the deny list reactively
# after it leaked into the shipped classifier.

# T-2364's own probe (`Claude/Loki/t2364-probe/p02_mnemonic_census.py`)
# computes 1523/539/428/111, using a "named" set that includes
# `_X86_GPR_ALLOW` -- a list check (B), not check (A), consults, and which
# check (A) never reads on ANY branch, vector-operand or not. Reproduced
# independently, twice, this session (T-2366), using ONLY the allow-list
# check (A) itself actually consults for a vector-touching instruction
# (`_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW`; the self-zeroing xorps/vxorps family contributed
# zero additional members under a differing-operand probe at that time,
# since it never matched a differing-operand construction): 1523
# vocabulary, 539 accepted by check (A) on a vector operand, of which 438
# passed ONLY the structural rule and 101 were named by
# `_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW` explicitly. Neither D-SLM4999's 481/58 nor T-2364's
# 428/111 reproduced against the classifier actually consulted; 438/101 was

    A membership pin needs no such classifier: ANY change to this set -- a
    capstone upgrade adding OR removing a member -- is exactly the
    observable signal D-SLM4999's residual concern needs, whether or not
    the new member turns out to be genuinely floating point, and is a

    confirmed-FP addition. On failure, a human determines whether each
    added member is genuine floating-point arithmetic (D-SLM4999's hole
    leaking a third time -- raise it, do not silently regenerate the pin)

    Re-aimed (T-2389 item 2, Poirot 8788b01 N6): the second leg used to
    assert that an existing but empty `<target>.dir` exits 2 "(zero
    objects found)". `main()` no longer enumerates `<target>.dir` at all
    -- the archive is the only corpus (D-SLM5100/D-SLM5101) -- so it
    reaches `find_target_archive`, finds no candidate, and exits 2 via
    the identical missing-archive path a NONEXISTENT build directory
    takes. An empty `<target>.dir` therefore graded nothing about object
    count; it duplicated the first leg under a different label.

    Re-aimed at what the driver actually discriminates: a `<target>.dir`
    carrying a REAL compiled object, still with no archive at any
    candidate path. This is the design's own "THE ARCHIVE IS THE ONLY
    CORPUS -- NO FALLBACK" claim, not yet pinned anywhere else in this
    suite -- `main()`'s own comment cites it (design Sec7 dim 11's
    restored fortieth population, D-SLM5103) but no cell exercises a
    populated object directory against a missing archive. Able to fail
    for its own reason -- proven by mutation this round (T-2389 casebook,
    `Claude/Curie/t2389-1p3-test-surface-repairs-2026-08-29.md`):
    monkeypatching `find_target_archive` so it fabricates a hit (any real,
    well-formed archive elsewhere on disk) for this exact populated,
    archive-less build directory turns the exit code from 2 to 0 (PASS),
    and the assertion below catches it. (A literal object-directory
    fallback that mis-encodes the raw `.obj` itself as an archive is
    instead caught one step later, by the malformed-archive check --
    still exit 2, but for a different reason; the fabricated-hit mutation
    isolates the property this leg actually pins: exit code 2 depends on
    the archive genuinely being absent from every candidate location, not
    on anything `find_target_archive` returns or on what is in
