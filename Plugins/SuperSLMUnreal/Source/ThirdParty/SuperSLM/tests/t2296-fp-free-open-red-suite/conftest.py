"""T-2368 (Curie) -- session-scoped real-build fixture for the fp-free-open
red suite (test_check_fp_free_scan.py), closing D-SLM5008's corpus-path
class.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three cells in that file read a directory named by a
literal string, "D:/SuperSLM/.worktrees/optb-build" -- configured once by
hand by the conductor from pre-restructure sources, versioned nowhere, and
created by no CI job. Measured consequence (D-SLM5008): a cell reading that
directory grades the scanner against a corpus that predates the remedy it
exists to observe, and the cell fails rather than skips when the directory
happens to be absent on a different machine, so the suite was red-by-
construction anywhere but the one machine it was hand-configured on. A
corpus cell derives its corpus from a build it causes, never from a path it
is told -- this fixture is that cause, built once per test session and
shared by every cell that needs the real corpus.

WHAT IT RUNS. The identical two-step recipe `.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s
own `fp-free-scan-gate` job runs against this exact checkout:

    cmake -B <dir>
    cmake --build <dir> --target superslm --config Release

producing the MSBuild/Visual-Studio-generator object layout
(`<dir>/superslm.dir/<config>/*.obj`) `tests/ci/scan_build_output.py`'s own
`find_target_objects` already knows how to walk, and the same build's own
`<dir>/Release/superslm.lib` -- the real ship gate's own production entry
point since T-2381/T-2385 reads the archive, never the directory (design
Sec4.1, D-SLM5100/D-SLM5101) -- so a cell built on this fixture is grading
the scanner against a real build laid out exactly as the gate reads it,
whichever of the two surfaces a given cell needs, not a second,
hand-derived layout.

RESOLUTION ORDER:

  1. SUPERSLM_FP_SCAN_BUILD_DIR, if set in the environment and naming an
     existing directory -- the mechanism a CI job (or a developer holding a
     build from a prior run of the identical recipe above) uses to skip
     paying for a second configure+build. Setting it is the caller's own
     assertion that the directory holds a build of the checkout under test;
     this fixture does not verify that beyond checking the directory exists,
     since a CI job wires this the same way it already wires `--build-dir`
     for the production gate itself.
  2. Otherwise, a fresh configure+build into
     out/t2368_fp_scan_corpus_build under this repository's own root --
     never under the OS temp directory (D-SLM4916: a CMake build tree under
     %TEMP% throws MSB8029) and always under this worktree, to keep every
     path the build and the scan both touch under the MAX_PATH-sensitive
     limit this suite's own environment note carries (D-SLM4893).

A toolchain genuinely absent (no VsDevCmd.bat found at either documented VS
2022 install location, or no cmake.exe at that install's own bundled CMake
path) or a configure/build that fails for any reason SKIPS every dependent
test with a stated reason -- it never fails them. No cell in this suite
tests whether `superslm` builds; the `windows-x64` and `fp-free-scan-gate`
CI jobs already do, and a machine that cannot produce this build is not a
machine where the scanner's own property is violated. Building once for
the whole session, rather than once per dependent cell, holds the cost of
proving this to a single configure+build regardless of how many cells
consult the corpus.
