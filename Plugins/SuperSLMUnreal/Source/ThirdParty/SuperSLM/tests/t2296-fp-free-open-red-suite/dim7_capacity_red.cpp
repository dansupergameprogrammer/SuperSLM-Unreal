//   Cell D -- GrowableIntMap's and GrowableContextMap's corrected `Grow()` formula (fold 26,
//             BUILT at this suite's authoring commit, 6041003) -- GREEN then, GREEN now.
//   Cell E -- `ContextEntry::counts{1}`'s own construction-site hint (fold 26, BUILT) --
//             GREEN then; lost discrimination once fold 27 landed for real, REVISED this
//             round (T-2312) -- see this cell's own function definition below.
//   Cell F -- GrowableIntSet's never-shrink compaction (fold 27, NOT YET BUILT at authoring)
//             -- RED then; fold 27 landed for real, GREEN now, unrevised.
//   Cell G -- GrowableContextMap's lazy construction (fold 27, NOT YET BUILT at authoring) --
//             RED then; fold 27 landed for real, GREEN now, unrevised.
//   Cell H -- order 1's own construction-site hint of 1 (fold 27, NOT YET BUILT at authoring)
//             -- RED then; fold 27 landed for real, GREEN now, unrevised.
//   Calibration-currency -- re-derives `AntiLmRetainedBytes`'s true understatement multiplier
//             at build/test time and asserts the published header range is a superset of it --
//             RED then (header stale); REVISED this round (T-2312) to read the published range
//             directly out of the header rather than a frozen copy -- see this cell's own
//             function definition below.
//
// T-2321 UPDATE (2026-08-27, Claude/Curie/t2321-cells-i-and-j-2026-08-27.md): Cells I and J
// authored, realizing design Sec7 dim 7's own seventh and eighth cells (fold rounds 28/30) --

// immediately below.
//   Cell I -- GrowableIntSet's own allocation count under steady erase-churn (fold 28,
//             D-SLM4796, NOT YET BUILT at this suite's current authoring commit -- Grow()
//             still carries fold round 27's formula) -- RED against the unmodified header,
//             for the design's own named reason (fold 27's formula does not fall with L);
//             flips GREEN under a temporary, reverted build of fold round 28's own target
//             formula.
//   Cell J -- GrowableIntSet's own capacity at its own first four Grow() trigger populations
//             (redesigned fold round 30, D-SLM4808, NOT YET BUILT) -- RED against the
//             unmodified header for the identical reason; flips GREEN under the same
//             temporary, reverted build; the design's own four named falsifying mutations
//             (1x/4x/8x/16x) reproduced, each failing the cell as a whole per its own
//             predicted pattern.
//
// T-2322 UPDATE (2026-08-27, Claude/Brunel/t2322-...): fold round 28's own target formula
// (BucketCountFor(2*(live_+1))) landed for real in Grow() at 91474c3, permanent -- `src/` and
// `include/` are read-only DELIVERABLES to this seat, not a state this suite reverts. Cells I
// and J are GREEN, unrevised, at their own function definitions below, which carry the
// current, authoritative RED/GREEN state rather than the "NOT YET BUILT" snapshot the T-2321
// block above describes at its own authoring commit.
//
// T-2324 UPDATE (2026-08-27, Claude/Curie/t2324-cellf-reachability-fix-2026-08-27.md): a code
// review (Claude/Poirot/t-2323-fold28-confirmation-review-2026-08-27.md) found fold round 28's
// own headroom doubling had silently consumed most of Cell F's own trigger margin (fixed below,
// at Cell F's own function definition) and that Cell I's own allocation-event identity was off
// by one (fixed below, at Cell I's own function definition). Neither Cell I nor Cell J's own
// assertions changed; both remain GREEN as the T-2322 UPDATE above states.
//
// WHY CELLS F/G/H WERE ALLOWED TO BE RED AT T-2310's OWN HANDOFF (historical; fold 27 is landed
// now): fold round 27 was design-only as of this suite's authoring
// (`Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-fold27-superslm-fp-free-open-2026-08-26.md` Sec9, Verdict/status:
// "PROPOSED... neither T-2306's two adopted levers nor S1's repair is built"). T-2310's own exit
// condition was every cell reported RED-or-GREEN against 6041003 WITH its reason, and every
// falsifying mutation executed -- not every cell green. Cells F/G/H/Calib's own mutation-proof
// (T-2310, reported in that ticket's own test-design record) TEMPORARILY built fold 27's own
// printed fix in the engine tree, confirmed each cell flipped GREEN, then reverted the engine
// tree to the unbuilt state -- proving discrimination in BOTH directions without leaving fold 27
// built, which was not this seat's authority at that time (Curie.md, "Does not implement"; that
// ticket's own brief, Sec2 -- src/ and include/ are read-only to Curie as a DELIVERABLE; a
// temporary, reverted mutation to prove discrimination is the sanctioned method, used again this
// round for Cell Calib's own falsifying leg -- see that cell's own comment below).
//
// THE CAPACITY-OBSERVATION PROBLEM AND HOW THIS FILE SOLVES IT. None of GrowableIntSet,
// GrowableIntMap, or GrowableContextMap exposes a public capacity/slot-count accessor (by
// design -- adding one would be production code this seat does not write). Cells D/E/F/G/H all
// need to observe an EXACT slot count from outside the type. This file solves it with the same
// instrumented-global-allocator technique T-2299's code review and T-2302's build measured this
// exact codebase with (`Claude/Brunel/t2302-footprint-probe/footprint_probe.cpp`, global
// `operator new`/`operator delete` overrides, base vs. new, attribution per
// StandardsDocument.md Sec4/Sec7 -- this file's own instrumentation, windowing, and calibration
// are an independent construction built for this suite's own need, not a copy of that probe's
// text): every heap allocation's REQUESTED size is recorded while "armed," inside a WINDOW the
// test resets at each checkpoint. Since every one of these types' own `Grow()`/constructor does
// exactly one `std::vector::assign`/count-construction per allocation event, and that event's
// byte size is (new slot count) x sizeof(Slot), dividing an observed window's byte total by an
// independently CALIBRATED sizeof(Slot) recovers the exact slot count -- without ever reading a
// private member. Calibration is always taken at a KNOWN capacity (`BucketCountFor(hint)`,
// itself a public free function, called directly rather than hand-computed) so sizeof(Slot) is
// derived, never assumed. Every division below is checked for an exact (zero-remainder)
// quotient first -- a nonzero remainder means an assumption about what allocated in that window
// was wrong, and the CHECK fails loudly instead of silently rounding to a plausible-looking
// number.
//
// CELL H'S OWN MIRROR STRUCT. `AntiLmState::ContextEntry` (src/damped_greedy_antilm.cpp) is
// PRIVATE to that translation unit -- defined inside `AntiLmState`, itself an opaque type
// outside it (only reachable through the C-ABI-shaped free functions
// `AntiLmCreate`/`AntiLmUpdate`/`AntiLmPenalize`/`AntiLmRetainedBytes`/`AntiLmDestroy`). Cell H
// needs `sizeof(GrowableContextMap<ContextEntry>::Slot)` to interpret order 1's own outer-table
// allocation, and there is no way to obtain it without either a production accessor (not this
// seat's to add) or a field-for-field MIRROR of ContextEntry's own declaration, compiled by the
// same compiler under the same layout rules. `ContextEntryMirror` below is that mirror --
// copied by reading src/damped_greedy_antilm.cpp's own printed declaration directly (not
// guessed), same field types, same order, same default member initializers. It is a
// calibration instrument, never constructed as if it were the real type and never asserted
// equal to it (there is no way to check that from outside) -- if ContextEntry's own field set
// or order ever changes, this mirror must change with it or Cell H's own calibration silently
// measures the wrong type; this coupling is disclosed here rather than hidden.
//
// EXECUTION MODEL: no child-process isolation is needed here (unlike dim7_contract_red.cpp) --
// none of these cells crashes or traps; every one is an ordinary in-process assertion. This
// file does, however, override the process's global `operator new`/`operator delete` for its
// own binary (build_link_red.bat compiles each cell file into its own separate .exe, so this
// override is scoped to dim7_capacity_red.exe alone and does not affect any other cell file's
// binary).

// construction (true pre-fold-27) so that allocation happened before the armed window opened.
// Fold round 27 (D-SLM4779) made that table's own slot-array allocation LAZY -- first touch,
// not construction -- so it no longer happens inside the unarmed `AntiLmCreate` call at all; it
// now happens on the very same `AntiLmUpdate` call this cell measures, landing inside the same
// window as `counts{1}`'s own first-insert allocation and making the two terms inseparable by
// the old method (T-2311, Claude/Brunel/t2311-fold27-build-2026-08-27.md Sec10, executed both
// directions: both the correct build and a `counts{1}`->`counts{}` mutation FAILED at the same
// assertion with different, equally uninterpretable numbers -- zero discrimination). The fix
// keeps the window exactly where it was (opened after the unarmed `AntiLmCreate` call, around
// `AntiLmUpdate` alone -- `AntiLmCreate`'s own state-object and tables_-backing-array
// allocations are unconditional on every fold and correctly excluded either way) and instead
// SUBTRACTS order 1's own outer-table first-touch cost as an explicit, independently-calibrated
// term (BucketCountFor(1) slots of an independently-calibrated sizeof(Slot)), the same
// isolation Cell H already performs for order 1's own outer-table claim below. This isolation
// is fold-27-SPECIFIC: it assumes the outer table's slot array allocates lazily, inside this
// same `AntiLmUpdate` call, and subtracts that term out of the window it measures. That
// assumption is correct for this ticket's own permanently-built state (`src/`/`include/` are
// READ-ONLY deliverables to this seat; fold 27 is landed, not reverted, going forward) and is
// exactly what the mutation-proof below verifies by execution.

// round budget below was a hardcoded 40, chosen against fold round 27's own capacity (32
// slots, first fire at round 9). Fold round 28 doubled this type's own headroom (Grow()'s
// sizing line, int_hash.h), which doubled the tombstone-driven trigger's own threshold, which
// moved the firing round to 27 of 40 -- thirteen rounds of margin where this comment (until
// this fold) still claimed thirty-one, against a capacity (32) two folds stale. One further
// doubling would have taken the firing round past the 40-round budget and left this cell
// GREEN while no longer exercising the property it exists to pin (D-SLM4777, the never-shrink
// property), silently, because assertion and reachability are different questions and the
// prior round's records checked only the first. Fixed below by deriving the round budget from
// THIS RUN'S OWN measured capacity rather than a constant correct against one fold's capacity
// -- see the round-budget comment in step 3 for the derivation and the executed margin at
// every headroom multiplier this fix was mutation-proved against.

// This cell needs no calibrated sizeof(Slot): GrowableIntSet<uint64_t, MixKey64>'s Key is POD

// this reading gives K, below, anything to "cover," and both readings execute to the
// identical PASS/FAIL verdict, so this is a clarity fix, not a discrimination change). Assert
// the total count is <= ceil(1000 / (L + 1)) + K, K = 8, at L in {7, 31, 127, 511}.

// file's instrumented allocator records after construction is exactly one Grow() call, no
// division or sizeof(Slot) calibration needed (unlike Cells D/E/H/J, which read an EXACT
// capacity and therefore need byte-to-slot-count division). The table is constructed UNARMED
// so its own single construction-time allocation is never counted: Grow() is a private

// populations with zero divergence (the pre-authorship audit, Sec6). Not this cell's claim to
// make and not mapped as one; recorded here, not investigated further, per that audit's own
// disposition.
//
// CAPACITY READ -- BYTE-FOR-BYTE AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT REFERENCE, NOT A DIVISION.
// Cell D's own division technique (window bytes / calibrated sizeof(Slot) = capacity) was
// tried first here and found NOT SOUND at the byte counts this cell's own larger populations
// reach -- a genuine finding, not assumed, discovered by execution:
// std::vector<T>::assign()/reserve() in this build (MSVC 19.33, /std:c++20) manually
// over-aligns any allocation whose requested byte size crosses an internal large-allocation
// threshold (empirically ~4096 bytes here), adding a FIXED, undocumented extra byte count to
// the raw request passed to `operator new` -- confirmed by an isolated `std::vector<T>`
// probe outside GrowableIntSet entirely, using a plain 16-byte POD with no relation to this
// type: `.assign(256, {})` requests 4135 bytes, not 4096; `.assign(512, {})` requests 8231,
// not 8192 -- the identical +39-byte residual both times, present even on a FRESH vector's
// FIRST allocation (not an artifact of reuse or growth history). This defeats a plain
// `bytes / sizeof(Slot)` division at N=129 and N=513 (both cross the threshold) while N=9 and
// N=33 (which do not) divide cleanly -- exactly the asymmetry an execution-first check
// catches and a by-construction assumption would not (StandardsDocument.md Sec5.4).
//
// The fix sidesteps needing to know that overhead's own formula: whatever it is, it is a
// property of the REQUESTED BYTE SIZE and the TARGET TYPE's size/alignment, not of
// GrowableIntSet specifically -- so it applies IDENTICALLY to an independently-built
// `std::vector<SlotProxy>` of the SAME element size (16 bytes, calibrated below) allocated to
// the SAME element count. Comparing GrowableIntSet's own measured byte footprint against that
// reference's measured byte footprint, byte-for-byte, is exact regardless of what the
// underlying allocator does at any threshold -- it never needs to be inverted or divided.
// SlotProxy is a field-for-field mirror of the private Slot ({Key key{}; State state{};},
// Key=uint64_t, State an enum class with a uint8_t underlying type -- same layout as a plain
