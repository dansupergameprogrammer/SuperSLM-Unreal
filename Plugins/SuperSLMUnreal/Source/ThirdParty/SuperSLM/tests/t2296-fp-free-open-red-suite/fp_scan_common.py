"""T-2326 (Curie) -- shared toolchain and raw-decode helpers for
test_check_fp_free_scan.py.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT: it is not the deciding instrument (design Sec4.1) and it
implements none of that instrument's own logic -- no symbol-table membership rule,
no per-ISA register-file/mnemonic allowlist (checks (A)/(B)/(C)), no REFUSE
control-action, no CI-gate contract. Building any of that here would make this
module a maker-authored stand-in for the thing under test, which is Brunel's
build, not Curie's. What lives here is strictly narrower and answers only "does
this fixture, once compiled, genuinely carry the byte-level property its own
population claims" -- a raw capstone decode of a byte string or a compiled
object's own code bytes, and nothing that adjudicates ACCEPT/REJECT/REFUSE.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS: three toolchain invokers (clang, MSVC cl.exe, MSVC ml64.exe,
each via subprocess, each returning a clean (ok, message) pair rather than raising,
so a caller can SKIP -- loudly, with a named reason -- when a toolchain is not
installed in this environment, exactly the `requires_clang`/`_clang_available()`
convention already established in tests/ci/test_check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py)
and a minimal object-file byte reader (`code_section_bytes`) that extracts a named
section's raw bytes from a compiled ELF64 or COFF object without interpreting
them -- capstone does the actual decoding, in the test file itself, one call per
population so each test states its own expected mnemonics next to its own
assertion.

# "no VsDevCmd.bat found at either well-known VS2022 install location". `vswhere.exe` ships at
# this fixed path with every VS 2022 installer regardless of edition or install location
# (Microsoft's own documented contract for the tool), so it is queried first; the two hardcoded
# paths above remain the fallback for a machine where `vswhere.exe` itself is absent (a bare
# BuildTools-only install predating the Installer's own vswhere bundling). Mirrors
# `conftest.py`'s own `_vswhere_vsdevcmd_candidates`/`_find_vsdevcmd` in this same directory,
# which already carries this discovery for the corpus-build fixture; this module's own
# `find_vsdevcmd()` is the one `compile_cl`/`compile_ml64` actually call, and had not been

    NEVER CONCATENATED into one blob for decoding purposes -- confirmed by
    direct execution, this session, on two separate defects this shape
    produces:

    (1) A real MSVC cl.exe object compiled from ordinary STL-using C++
    carries hundreds of COMDAT code sections (`.text$mn` per template-
    instantiated function, `.text$x` for associated unwind thunks), never a
    single plain `.text` section -- one real object inspected this session
    carried 668 total sections, the large majority `.text$mn`. An exact-
    match reader silently returns "no section named .text" on any such
    object, which is every cl.exe object this suite compiles -- fixed by a
    PREFIX match (`.text$mn`/`.text$x`/plain `.text` all start with `.text`).

    (2) A prefix match alone is not sufficient: concatenating every matched
    section into one continuous byte stream and decoding it start-to-finish
    was found, this session, to silently stop finding real instructions
    partway through a real AArch64 object -- `.text$x` unwind-thunk sections
    interleaved among the `.text$mn` code sections are NOT AArch64
    instructions, and capstone's own `disasm()` generator stops permanently
    at the first byte range it cannot decode, so every `.text$mn` section
    AFTER the first `.text$x` thunk in file order was silently never reached
    (confirmed directly: a real object's own BodyDivide/BodyConvertCompare
    sections, both real and both containing genuine fdiv/scvtf instructions,
    produced ZERO f-prefixed mnemonics anywhere when decoded as one
    concatenated blob). Returning one blob PER SECTION and decoding each
    independently is what this repair requires, and what this function does.
