"""T-2367 (Brunel), D-SLM5001 item (3) -- pin for the seven switch-jump-table
symbols' own restructure (D-SLM4359, D-SLM4988).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `test_check_fp_free_scan.py`'s own
`test_dslm4359_seven_switch_jump_table_symbols_must_not_block_gate`
(T-2366) scans the real, already-built corpus at
`D:/SuperSLM/.worktrees/optb-build` -- a read-only reference build this
ticket's own environment section names as "read-only to you, so configure
your own." That corpus is compiled from engine commit `a1df129`, which
predates this build round's own source changes entirely; it can never
reflect this remedy until whoever owns that shared directory rebuilds it
from a commit that includes this round's work, and rebuilding it is outside
this ticket's writable scope. The remedy itself is verified directly this
session against a freshly configured build
(`D:/SuperSLM/.worktrees/t2367-bld`, `cmake -S ... -B ... && cmake --build
... --target superslm --config Release`): 0 REJECT, 0 REFUSE under checks
(A)/(B) for all seventeen objects, where the pre-remedy build read 264
REJECT / 1 REFUSE (`Claude/Brunel/t2367-fp-gate-build-round-2026-08-28.md`).

This file pins the remedy at the one level that does not depend on any
external build directory staying current: the SOURCE ITSELF. Per
`StandardsDocument.md`'s standing law that a fix round's newest production
change is structurally the one nobody pins, this is a NEW cell for a remedy
this round actually landed (the seven-symbol switch-to-if-chain
restructure), not a re-statement of the existing, environment-dependent
seven-symbol sweep above.

T-2371 (Brunel), D-SLM5017/D-SLM5021/D-SLM5018 S1. The original form of
`test_seven_switch_jump_table_symbols_preserve_every_named_branch` asserted
each function's branch count against a hardcoded literal (21, 7, 32, 61, 6,
17) parsed only from the function's own body -- so a header gaining an
enumerator with no matching arm left the literal (and the body's own count)
unchanged, and the pin stayed green through exactly the regression it
existed to catch. Five of the six restructured functions below were
genuinely exhaustive switches before the restructure (verified at source
against each enum's own header, AS OF THIS RESTRUCTURE: `SslmForwardStatus`
32/32, `SslmModelStatus` 61/61, `ConfigGeometryStatus` 6/6, `SslmSectionType`
21/21 for `IsKnownSectionType` -- T-2441 Minor 7 later added ZeroHeadDim/
ZeroHiddenSize, making `ConfigGeometryStatus` 8/8 as of T-2445; the general
exhaustiveness check below re-derives the current count from the header on
every run rather than trusting this paragraph's own snapshot) -- the state
in which a compiler's own
`-Wswitch` warns on a newly added enumerator. The sixth, `SectionTypeName`,
was exhaustive only over the seventeen-enumerator `SslmSectionType` that
existed when it was authored; four enumerators (`CalibrationBand`,
`DeltaFoldScales`, `UFoldScales`, `DampedGreedyConstants`) were added to
the header afterward with no matching arm here, a real, pre-existing gap
this round closes in `src/proof_manifest.cpp` itself (D-SLM5018 S1) rather
than leaving unexhaustive. `ExpectedDtype`'s restructure similarly replaced
fourteen explicit case labels (all mapped to `Raw`) with an implicit
fallthrough default; this round restores all twenty-one as explicit
comparisons in `src/artifact.cpp` (same output for every input) so its own
text states the same completeness the switch it replaced did. All six are
therefore now genuinely exhaustive over their own enum, and this file
derives each one's EXPECTED set of named enumerators from the enum's own
header instead of a literal, asserting SET equality (not just a count, so
a duplicated comparison cannot silently stand in for a missing one) --
restoring exactly the property `-Wswitch` provided, checkable on every
platform including the ones that never had `-Wswitch` (MSVC's own `C4062`
is off at `/W4`), and proven both ways below: green against the real,
unmutated headers, and provably red against a header carrying one
unhandled enumerator, by construction.
