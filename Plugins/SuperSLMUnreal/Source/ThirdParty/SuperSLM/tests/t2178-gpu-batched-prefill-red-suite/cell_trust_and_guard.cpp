// confirmation.md): the WARM-arm extension of `TestGuard_ContextReusableAfterCaughtTailFault`
// above. That cell's own candidate sequence is fresh when the fault fires -- the resume-barrier
// latch (superslm_gpu.cpp, `io_external_kv_needs_resume_barrier`) starts false on a freshly
// created handle (gpu_1p0.cpp's own UNORDERED_ACCESS creation state), the one shape in which S1's
// remedy (`*io_external_kv_needs_resume_barrier = false` in the `!tail_executed` branch,
// superslm_gpu.cpp's tail `runtime_error` catch) happens to write the correct value. Every
// ordinary prompt exceeds `kT2169TdrSafeMaxChunkTokens` (4) tokens and therefore reaches the
// latch's STEADY state (true) before any fault can occur -- S1's own failure sequence. This cell
// reproduces that sequence:
//
//   call 1 (warm-up): a successful multi-sub-chunk prefill on a FRESH sequence, driving the latch
//     from its creation-time false through at least one genuine resume-barrier read/write cycle
//     to its true steady state (buffer left in COPY_SOURCE).
//   call 2 (fault): the SAME pre-Close tail fault `TestGuard_ContextReusableAfterCaughtTailFault`
//     injects, on the SAME sequence -- reached with the latch already true, the shape that cell's
//     own fresh-handle construction cannot reach.
//   call 3 (probe): a third call on the SAME sequence, no fault armed. Two oracles, both against
//     THIS single call:
//     (a) the resulting sequence state bit-compares against a reference sequence driven through
//         the identical successful history (warm-up, then this same third call) with the fault
//         never injected -- the discarded call's whole effect must be invisible, not merely
//         non-crashing (T-2192's own "not merely 'not crash'" standard, restated at that cell's
//         own token-match oracle).
//     (b) the D3D12 debug layer's validation-message drain, scoped to exactly this call
//         (`DrainDebugLayerMessages`, d3d12_harness.h) -- S1's predicted defect is a resume
//         barrier asserting StateBefore=UNORDERED_ACCESS against a resource genuinely in
//         COPY_SOURCE, which the debug layer is documented to flag as a validation ERROR (the
//         SAME oracle `TestGuard_ContextReusableAfterCaughtTailFault` already uses at its own
//         second call). Only meaningful with SSLM_GPU_ENABLE_DEBUG_LAYER=1 -- see that macro's
//         header comment.
//
// This cell is also T-2192 finding S4's own commissioning construction (StandardsDocument.md
// Sec5.4's must-reject): the sibling pins' `..._validation_messages == 0` assertions have a
// must-accept (a clean run scores zero) and no prior must-reject -- nothing showed a genuinely
// desynced latch produces a message on this device/driver. Oracle (b) here is exactly that
// must-reject, authored independently of the S1 remedy's own author and producible by the real
// data path (no seam beyond the pre-existing pre-Close tail-fault injection this suite's sibling
// cells already use). If it fires, the instrument is commissioned and S1 is confirmed by
// execution in the same run; if the assertion in (b) passes anyway (no message despite the
// mismatched transition), that is the S4 refutation of S1's reachability on this device/driver,
// and the instrument stays quarantined -- this cell reports whichever the execution shows, not a

// (`sslm_decode_step_gpu` via `SubmitOneSequenceDecode`, gpu_1p0.cpp) calls DIRECTLY, one submit
// call per `kDispatchBudget`-worth of layers, reached from the public surface through
// `SslmGpuSeqDecodeStepForG5Bridge`'s own embed-then-drive branch -- the identical
// try/catch/entry-value-restore shape, landing from the containment's first commit rather than in
// two separate rounds (round 5's own commit message). No dedicated fault-injection pin existed
// for THIS site before this cell: the seam (`ArmT2169ChunkRecordingTailFaultInjection`) is
// extended (gpu_port.h, superslm_gpu.cpp) to also fire from `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit`'s own tail, at
// the identical pre-Close() point its sibling call site already uses -- arming plumbing only, no
// new production behavior; the throw it injects is the SAME `std::runtime_error` a real failed
// `Close()`/`Signal()` would raise.
//
// `SslmGpuSeqDecodeStepForG5Bridge` only reaches `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` when
// `seq->ready_for_logits` is false -- the branch that embeds `token_to_embed_if_needed` and calls
// `DriveGpuSeqToFullDepthForG5Bridge` (gpu_1p0.cpp), which loops `sslm_decode_step_gpu`/
// `sslm_gpu_ready` once per `kDispatchBudget`-worth of layers until `seq->layer_index` reaches
// `num_hidden_layers`. `ready_for_logits` is set true ONLY by the prefill bridges (never by this
// function itself), so every call in this cell's own three-call sequence takes that branch --
// unlike this file's OTHER decode-step calls, which always follow a prefill and therefore always
// take the ready_for_logits shortcut, never touching `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` at all.
//
//   call 1 (warm-up): a successful decode step on a FRESH sequence -- embeds a token and drives
//     it through the full layer loop, at least one genuine `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` call
//     succeeding and setting the resume-barrier latch to its true steady state (buffer left in
//     COPY_SOURCE) -- the state a fault immediately after warm-up genuinely starts from, the
//     shape S1's own remedy account names as the one the fresh-handle sibling pins cannot reach.
//   call 2 (fault): the SAME pre-Close tail fault the chunk-path pins inject, now reached inside
//     `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit`'s own tail via the per-token drive -- fires on the FIRST internal
//     submit call this decode step issues (armed before the call, single-shot), with the latch
//     already true.
//   call 3 (probe): a third decode step on the SAME sequence, no fault armed.
//     `sslm_gpu_seq_embed_token` resets `layer_index` to 0 and does not touch `context_length`
//     (gpu_1p0.cpp:1214-1266) -- `context_length` only advances once a token's full traversal
//     finishes, so the faulted call's own aborted embed leaves no committed trace for this call to
//     inherit; this call's own resulting state is the ONLY thing under test. Two oracles, both
//     against this single call, mirroring the chunk pin's own pair exactly:
//     (a) the resulting sequence state bit-compares against a reference sequence driven through
//         the identical successful two-call history (warm-up, then this same third call) with the
//         fault never injected, AND this call's own produced token (a decode step's own
//         `out_token` -- no separate following call is needed, unlike the chunk pin's own prefill
//         arms) must match the reference's.
//     (b) the D3D12 debug layer's validation-message drain, scoped to exactly this call -- a
//         SECOND, independently-producible construction of the identical defect class the
//         chunk-path sibling `TestGuard_ContextReusableAfterCaughtTailFaultWarmArm` drives,
//         reached through a different public entry point and a different internal call site.
//         Per `d3d12_harness.h`'s own `DrainDebugLayerMessages()` header comment (T-2195's
//         DEMONSTRATED LIMIT paragraph), the drain itself is alive on this device/driver (it
//         reliably scores 0 on a clean call and prints real messages when the debug layer has
//         something to report), but its must-reject construction for THIS defect class -- a
//         resume-barrier transition recorded against the wrong prior state -- FAILED TO FIRE on
//         the RTX 2080 SUPER (driver 560.94): the sibling cell drove a source-confirmed reachable
//         instance of the exact defect through this exact drain and it returned 0. This cell's own
