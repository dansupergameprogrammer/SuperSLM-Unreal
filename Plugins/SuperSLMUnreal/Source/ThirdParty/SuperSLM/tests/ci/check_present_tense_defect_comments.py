"""CI source check: T-1331's defect class -- a test-suite comment that cites one
of this project's review-severity findings (Critical N / Significant N / Weak N /
Structural N -- the labels this codebase's own review casebooks use to number a
finding, verbatim, e.g. "Critical 1", "Significant 5") must also show, in the same
comment block, that the finding is resolved: either the literal word "closed", or
a cited ticket ID (`T-<digits>`). A comment carrying the label with neither is
flagged (SuperSLM_S3a_WalkingSkeleton_Plan.md Sec11 intro, Sec14.12; D-SLM411,
D-SLM414, D-SLM418; board T-1337).

WHY THIS SHAPE, NOT THE PLAN'S LITERAL CANDIDATE. Sec14.12 proposes "a present-
tense defect comment must cite the ticket that pins it, so the comment fails when
that ticket closes without the comment changing." Read literally that is a TWO-
PART mechanism: (1) require a citation, (2) invalidate it when the cited ticket's
STATUS changes. Part (2) is not buildable inside this repository's CI: ticket
lifecycle lives on the board (`Claude/Zelda/Board.md`) and in the decision log
(`Claude/Decisions/DecisionLog.md`), both in a *different* project tree, not
checked out by this repo's CI jobs and not vendored here. A job running on this
repo's stock checkout has no way to ask "is T-1234 still open" -- it can only ask
"does this comment cite something." Confirmed against real data: recovering the
seven historical sites this class was found at (below) shows NONE of them cited a
literal ticket ID at all -- five cited a review-casebook filename plus a severity
label ("Critical 1 (Poirot fa3189a-...-review-2026-07-28.md)"), and the sixth (a
CHECK_MSG failure-message string) cited only the label. So "must cite A ticket" as
literally written would flag every one of these sites' own FIXED, current-truth
comments too (the fix rewrote five of the seven to cite "(closed; ...)" rather
than a ticket ID) -- a check built to the letter of the candidate would fire
forever on correct, current text, which fails the "does not fire on clean input"
half of the exit condition on its very first real-tree run. What is actually
buildable, and validated below against the real historical population: requiring
a **resolution marker** ("closed", or a cited ticket ID where one IS given, as the
seventh site's own fix does) alongside the severity-label citation. This is
Part (1) made real, plus the one form Part (2) can take without cross-repo access:
a human (or a future job with board access) revisits every "T-<n>, not yet closed"
comment; this module cannot tell the difference between an OPEN cited ticket and
a CLOSED one on its own, and says so below rather than silently mis-claiming it.

RULE COVERAGE, MEASURED. `tests/ci/present_tense_defect_historical_fixtures/`
holds the exact text of all seven sites T-1331/T-1334 found (D-SLM411, D-SLM414),
recovered from `D:\\SuperSLM` git history at fa5113d^ (six sites) and ee76dbd^ (the
seventh) -- the state BEFORE each was rewritten -- paired with each site's current,
fixed text at HEAD. `test_check_present_tense_defect_comments.py`'s
`test_fires_on_every_historical_pre_fix_site` and
`test_does_not_fire_on_any_historical_post_fix_site` replay both states through
this module's own scanner (never through a hand-transcribed stand-in) and assert
7/7 fire before the fix and 0/7 false-fire after it -- fixing nothing here, per
StandardsDocument Sec4's population-validation requirement.

INPUT COVERAGE. The default scan surface is `tests/**/*.cpp`, `tests/**/*.h`, and
`tests/**/*.py` -- the obligation's own text scopes it to "this campaign's test
suite" (plan Sec11 intro), not production source; `src/` and `include/` also carry
some of these same severity-label citations (as provenance on a fix, not as a live
defect claim) and are deliberately outside this check's scope for that reason.

KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, NAMED RATHER THAN SUPPRESSED. A purely navigational section
header that cites several severity labels as an index (no defect language at all)
also lacks a resolution marker and is flagged by this rule as written, when the
labels carry a digit the way this codebase's severity-label citations normally
do. This paragraph's own example is deliberately written without digits instead
-- "the remediation red suite for Critical A, Critical B, and Significant C",
letter-suffixed per this codebase's own "Significant B"-style coverage-tag
convention -- so `SEVERITY_LABEL_PATTERN`'s digit requirement (defined below)
does not match it and this module's own default-glob self-scan does not flag its
own text; T-1545's paragraph-granular fix (below) would otherwise have turned a
digit-labeled version of this same sentence into a live, uncited self-scan hit,
where before that fix a single docstring-wide block masked it behind an
unrelated "closed" citation elsewhere in the same then-one-block docstring
(28aa351 Significant 2/prior Significant 3). Narrowing the rule to require a
negation word ("no"/"never"/"not") alongside the label would suppress that false
positive -- but it also suppresses a REAL, independently found instance of this
exact defect class (see the module's own casebook/build-log citation for the
discovered site), which contains no negation word at all ("... reads unmapped
heap memory ..." stated as present fact, no "no"/"never"). Between a rule that
over-flags a benign header and one that misses a real defect, this module keeps
the wider rule and reports both outcomes plainly rather than tuning against
either.

Modelled on tests/ci/check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py's own conventions: a text
scan (not a full C++ parse) over a glob-derived file set, a `scan_files` entry
point returning formatted failure strings, and a `main()` that fails loud.

BLOCK-BOUNDARY HARDENING (T-1485). The first real-tree run of this check found
two mechanical gaps in `_iter_blocks`, both scoped to `.py` files and both
fixed here with their own regression cells in the test module: (1) a Python
multi-line triple-quoted docstring's OPENING line happens to start with `"`
and so passed the plain-STRING check, but every following line does not start
with a quote character at all, so only the opening line was ever scanned --
silently hiding a resolution marker that in fact appeared later in the same
docstring, and reporting a fragment of a fully-cited docstring as an uncited
one. (2) `tests/gen_*.py`'s own convention -- a Python list of string
literals, one per generated-file physical line, used to build multi-line C++
output text -- was merged as ONE contiguous STRING block for every
consecutive line that happened to be a complete Python string starting with
`"`, whether or not that line's own content was a `//` comment; a five-line
generated comment was found merged, this way, into an eighteen-line block
that also swallowed a struct definition and blank-line placeholders between
witnesses. `_PY_QUOTED_CPP_COMMENT_PATTERN` fixes (2): a quoted `//` line
now merges only with adjacent quoted `//` lines.

TOKENIZE-DERIVED PYTHON STRING SPANS (T-1538). T-1485's fix for (1) tracked a
`.py` multi-line triple-quoted string by per-physical-line triple-quote
PARITY -- a line outside a string whose triple-quote count was odd was read
as opening one, with no whole-file notion of whether a string was already
open. Any ordinary line carrying an odd count of triple-quote markers --
including a comment merely naming the delimiter, or this module's own
`_TRIPLE_QUOTE_MARKERS` tuple declaration -- flipped that parity for the
remainder of the file: every later docstring's closing line then read as an
opener and every opening line as a closer, so code was scanned as string
text and docstring bodies were skipped entirely. Applied to `.cpp`/`.h`
inputs (no line in C++ ever closes a phantom Python string), one such stray
run collapsed the rest of the file into a single block, silencing every
citation below it.

`_iter_blocks` no longer does per-line triple-quote parity tracking at all.
For a `.py` file, the physical lines that fall inside a multi-line STRING
token are taken from Python's own `tokenize` module
(`_python_multiline_string_lines`) -- ground truth, not a heuristic
re-derived one line at a time -- and `.cpp`/`.h` inputs get no triple-quote
handling whatsoever, so a stray triple-quote marker inside a C++ comment can
no longer collapse the file. A `.py` file that `tokenize` cannot parse raises
`PythonTokenizeError`, which `scan_files` reports as a per-file failure
rather than silently treating the unparseable file as clean.

F-STRING TOKEN COVERAGE AND PARAGRAPH-GRANULAR STRING BLOCKS (T-1545). T-1538's
`_python_multiline_string_lines` collected only `tokenize.STRING` spans. Since
Python 3.12 a multi-line f-string is not emitted as a `STRING` token at all --
it is `FSTRING_START` / `FSTRING_MIDDLE` (itself possibly multi-line) /
`FSTRING_END` -- so a multi-line f-string's physical lines fell through to
`_line_kind` uncovered: its opening line starts with `f`, not a quote
character, so it (and every following line, none of which starts with a
quote either) classified `OTHER` and no block formed at all, silently
admitting an uncited citation inside it (Poirot
884ee74-t1485-present-tense-gate-blocking-review-2026-07-31.md Significant
1, confirmed 28aa351 Significant 1). `_python_multiline_string_lines` now
tracks the span from each `FSTRING_START` to its matching `FSTRING_END`
(depth-counted, so a nested same-quote f-string does not close the span
early) as well as ordinary multi-line `STRING` tokens, on interpreters that
expose the f-string token family; on an interpreter without it (Python <
3.12), only ordinary `STRING` tokens are tracked, which is the complete
Python string-token vocabulary on that interpreter.

Separately: `_iter_blocks` merged every physical line the tokenizer placed
inside a multi-line STRING (or now f-string) span into one block regardless
of blank lines within it, because forced-STRING lines bypassed `_line_kind`
--  the classifier that already treats a blank line as a break for `//`
comments and bare-string continuations -- entirely. A resolution marker
anywhere in a multi-line docstring or module-level string therefore silently
satisfied a citation anywhere else in the same string, however far apart
and however many blank lines separated them (confirmed 28aa351 Significant
2/prior Significant 3: this module's own docstring was one such string at
that commit, and one `closed` inside it cleared six unrelated severity-label
citations -- T-1559 retired the two present-tense clauses that stood here,
both false by the time they were read: the line count had moved and the
docstring had long since been many blocks rather than one). A blank line now
breaks a block the same way inside a
tokenizer-forced string span as outside one, so a multi-line string is
scanned at paragraph granularity -- one block per blank-line-delimited
paragraph -- consistent with how `//` comment runs and bare C string-literal
continuations already break at a blank or non-continuing line.

LITERAL-IDENTITY-AWARE BLOCK BOUNDARIES (T-1553). T-1545's fix widened the
line pool `_python_multiline_string_lines` returns to cover f-strings, but
still flattened it to one `frozenset[int]` of physical line numbers with no
record of which literal each line belongs to. `_iter_blocks` merges by
adjacency alone, so two DISTINCT multi-line string literals with no blank
line between them -- an f-string ending on one line immediately followed by a
plain triple-quoted string starting on the next, exactly the shape T-1545's
own widened pool newly admits -- read as one block, and a resolution marker
in the first silently satisfied an uncited citation in the second (Poirot
d2a7eed-t1547-present-tense-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 1; latent
on plain-plain adjacent literals since before T-1545 too, per the same
finding). `_python_multiline_string_lines` now returns each literal's own
`(start, end)` line range rather than a flattened set of line numbers, and
`_iter_blocks` closes the current block whenever a new literal's start line
is reached, the same way a blank line already closes it.

TOTAL BOUNDARIES: SPAN MEMBERSHIP, NOT JUST SPAN STARTS (T-1557). The break
above is directional -- it fires when a span BEGINS and not when one ENDS,
because a single-line literal produces no span and so contributes no start
line, while still classifying STRING through `_line_kind`. A multi-line
literal immediately followed by a single-line string literal therefore still
read as ONE block, and a resolution marker in the first silently satisfied an
uncited citation in the second: the same defect class as T-1553, at the one
boundary that remedy did not reach (Poirot
b2b00b4-t1556-adjacency-fold-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 1, found
latent -- zero live instances, and the reverse ordering was already caught,
which is what exposed the asymmetry). `_iter_blocks` now carries whether the
previous line was inside any span and breaks when that changes, so the
boundary holds in both directions. Two adjacent literals with no blank line
between them get two blocks whenever at least one of them is multi-line.
Two SINGLE-line literals still merge, and so do two quoted-`//` lines: both
sit wholly outside every span, both are deliberate (the bare C string-literal
continuation rule and `_PY_QUOTED_CPP_COMMENT_PATTERN` respectively), and
splitting them would fire false positives across the fixture generators.

A SECOND, INDEPENDENT DEFECT CLASS: A "NOT YET BUILT" CLAIM SURVIVING ITS OWN
BUILD ROUND (T-2385, fold round 43, closing T-2382 finding S3). A test-suite
docstring or comment can assert, in present tense, that a surface is unbuilt
and its cells `xfail`-marked ("NONE OF THIS IS BUILT YET", "scan_build_
output.py does not read archives at all yet", "the still-unbuilt half") while
the build round that lands the surface removes every `xfail` marker the
prose was describing and leaves the prose itself untouched. This is NOT the
class `SEVERITY_LABEL_PATTERN`/`RESOLUTION_MARKER_PATTERN` above catch: that
pair requires a specific citation shape ("Critical N"/"Significant N"/etc.)
this prose never uses, so a docstring saying "not yet built" is invisible to
it by construction -- confirmed twice on the same red suite
(`tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/`), one round apart: D-SLM5018 S1/S3
filed it first, and it recurred at scale (nine sites across two files) in
the very build round that closed it (T-2382 finding S3).

RULE COVERAGE, MEASURED. `_UNBUILT_CLAIM_PATTERN` (below) is a set of the
exact phrasings this codebase has used for "not built yet," recovered from
the real T-2382 finding rather than authored in the abstract: a bare
`not yet built` (the `pytest.fail` guards this suite's own cells raised
before the production module existed), `NONE OF THIS IS BUILT`, `still
globs` (naming the pre-archive directory-glob path by name), `genuinely
red-unimplemented`, a bare `unbuilt` (catching `still-unbuilt`,
`(unbuilt -- xfail)`, and `unbuilt archive-composition`), `does not read
archives`, `coincidentally the correct exit code`/`coincidentally exits N`
(the "right answer for the wrong reason" shape), and a future-tense
`will ... once ... lands/ships/builds` construction (T-2382's own finding
that a docstring describing a landed interface in future tense is the same
defect wearing different grammar). Validated (T-2385, this session) against
the real historical population at commit `7a77a07^{tree}`'s own two files,
`test_archive_composition.py` and `test_archive_gate.py`: both flag before
the fix (nine sites, D-SLM5018-shaped), and both are clean after it --
`test_check_present_tense_unbuilt_class.py` (`tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-
suite/`, this round's own test pin, since this module's own test file is
outside this ticket's writable scope) replays both states, now from
fixture files vendored in the pin's own directory rather than `git show`
(see "POPULATION RECOVERY IS VENDORED, NOT LIVE `git show`" below).

WHITESPACE-TOLERANT MATCHING (T-2387, Poirot
8788b01-t2386-archive-gate-confirmation.md N2). Every alternative above
that spans more than one word originally spelled its internal spaces as a
literal `" "`, and this suite's own docstrings are hard-wrapped near
column 72 -- so a trigger phrase that happens to straddle a line break was
invisible to the pattern. Measured against the real historical population
at `7a77a07^{tree}`: the literal-space pattern matched 12 of the real
occurrences in `test_archive_composition.py`/`test_archive_gate.py`; two
more -- `does not read` / `archives` and `coincidentally` / `the correct
exit code`, each pair split across a line break -- were missed for no
reason other than the line wrap, reaching 14 once each internal literal
space is replaced with `\\s+` (already the case for the future-tense
alternative's own `[^.]{0,N}` gaps, which admit newlines). Neither miss
changed this check's own verdict on either
historical file (both still flagged, on a different phrase), but the
pattern's OWN rule-coverage cells fed it single-line synthetic strings and
so could not see the gap -- exactly the commissioning failure
`StandardsDocument.md` Sec5.4 names: a maker-authored control the real
input can, and did, fail to reproduce. `_UNBUILT_CLAIM_PATTERN` below is
now whitespace-tolerant throughout, and the pin adds one wrapped-fixture
cell per multi-word alternative alongside the existing single-line ones.

POPULATION RECOVERY IS VENDORED, NOT LIVE `git show` (T-2387, Poirot
8788b01-t2386-archive-gate-confirmation.md N1). The pin's two
historical-population cells used to recover `7a77a07`'s pre-fix text with
a live `git show <sha>` subprocess call, skipping (not failing) when that
command could not resolve the commit. Measured: a real
`git clone --depth 1` of this repository -- the checkout every job in
`.github/workflows/tests.yml` performs, none of them setting
`fetch-depth` -- resolves that `git show` with exit 128, so both cells
skipped and the pin reported green in the exact environment that gates it.
The pin now reads the pre-fix text of both files from two fixture files
vendored in its own directory
(`present_tense_unbuilt_class_historical_fixtures/`), recovered once by
this fix and committed alongside it; recovery no longer depends on git
history being present at all, in CI or anywhere else.

INPUT COVERAGE, DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN THE SEVERITY-LABEL CHECK ABOVE.
`_UNBUILT_CLAIM_GLOBS` scans only `tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/`,
not the whole `tests/` tree `_DEFAULT_TEST_GLOBS` covers. Measured (T-2385):
the identical trigger phrases scanned against the whole `tests/` tree hit
two unrelated, correctly-worded files
(`tests/ci/check_checked_chain_funnel_position_cap_not_a_stub.py` and its
own test file) that quote a PAST "still-unbuilt"-shaped defect as the
worked example inside a check built to detect that exact class on a
DIFFERENT function -- accurate historical narration, not a live claim about
current build status, and outside this ticket's own writable scope to
correct even if it were the same defect. Widening this check's own input
coverage to the whole tree the day a real instance is found outside this
suite is the same discipline `_DEFAULT_TEST_GLOBS` above was widened under
(T-1485 through T-1564); until then, scoping to the two files this defect
has recurred in twice keeps the check honest about what it has actually
been validated against.

THE MARKER, AND WHY FILE-GRANULARITY RATHER THAN BLOCK-GRANULARITY. The
severity-label check above requires the citation and its resolution marker
in the SAME comment/docstring block, because a citation and an unrelated
"closed" elsewhere in the file must not silently satisfy each other
(T-1545's own paragraph-granularity fix exists for exactly this reason).
This check's own marker is checked at FILE granularity on purpose: the
defect this check pins is not "a citation and its marker disagree within
one block," it is "this file's prose describes a whole surface as
unbuilt-and-xfailed, and the file's own marker count is zero" -- a fact
about the file as a whole, which is exactly what T-2382 found (zero
`xfail(strict=True)` markers survive in either file, confirmed by direct
count, while the prose describing them does).

WHAT COUNTS AS THE MARKER (T-2387, Poirot
8788b01-t2386-archive-gate-confirmation.md N3/N4). File-granularity means
ONE thing has to be true of the file, not that ANY `@pytest.mark.xfail`
anywhere clears ANY trigger phrase anywhere -- the original form did the
latter, and it was wrong twice over. First (N3): `test_check_fp_free_scan.
py` carried a stale `# ... -- NOT YET BUILT` import-guard comment (line
245, predating the archive round) that was cleared by three markers whose
own `reason=` text is D-SLM5009's and T-2347's genuinely open questions --
having nothing to do with whether that import is built. The file "has not
had its markers stripped out from under its prose" was true of the file's
own markers and false of that comment: a marker with no relationship to a
claim should not launder it. Second (N4): a live marker was found by a bare
`_XFAIL_MARKER_PATTERN.search(text)` over the WHOLE raw file text, which
cannot tell a real `@pytest.mark.xfail(...)` decorator from a Python string
literal that merely spells the same characters -- this module's own pin
file (`test_check_present_tense_unbuilt_class.py`) carries every trigger
phrase verbatim as fixture DATA and was saved from flagging only because
one of its fixture strings happens to also spell `@pytest.mark.xfail(`
literally; a checker that cannot be caught by its own rule for an
accidental reason is the shape of the defect it hunts.

Both are closed the same way: `_xfail_decorator_source_texts` finds every
REAL decorator via `ast.parse` (a string that merely spells decorator
syntax is not a decorator node and is never returned), and
`find_stale_unbuilt_claim` requires that at least one such decorator's own
source text -- the whole `@pytest.mark.xfail(...)` call, `reason=` included
-- ITSELF matches `_UNBUILT_CLAIM_PATTERN` before treating the file as
covered. A marker about an unrelated open question no longer launders a
claim it says nothing about, and a fixture string that only spells marker
syntax is never mistaken for one. File granularity is preserved -- this is
still "does the file, as a whole, carry a marker for this claim," not a
per-block or per-function scope -- but the marker itself is real and
on-topic rather than merely present.

THE PIN'S OWN FILE IS EXCLUDED BY NAME, NOT BY ACCIDENT (T-2387, N4). Even
with the tightened marker rule above, this module's own pin has no real
`@pytest.mark.xfail` decorators of its own (it decorates nothing; it
constructs fixture text), so its fixture strings would flag under the
tightened rule exactly as they would have flagged the moment its one
accidental marker-spelling string was refactored away. `_UNBUILT_CLAIM_
GLOBS`'s own matches are filtered against `_UNBUILT_CLAIM_EXCLUDE_
BASENAMES` in `main()` before scanning -- the same "known false positive,
scoped out by name and pinned by a test proving the exclusion is load-
bearing" shape the pin's own `_KNOWN_FALSE_POSITIVE_FILES` uses for the two
`tests/ci/` files named above -- so the exclusion no longer depends on what
any fixture string happens to spell.

    NOT flattened into a single set of line numbers -- so a caller can tell
    where one literal ends and the next begins even when two literals are
    physically adjacent with no blank line between them.

    Replaces this module's earlier per-physical-line triple-quote-PARITY
    heuristic (T-1485), which carried no whole-file notion of whether a
    string was already open: any ordinary line outside a string whose
    triple-quote count was odd -- a comment merely naming the delimiter, or
    this module's own former `_TRIPLE_QUOTE_MARKERS` declaration -- flipped
    the tracked polarity for the remainder of the file, so every later
    docstring's closing line read as an opener and every opening line as a
    closer. `tokenize` has no such state to desynchronise: each STRING
    token's own `start`/`end` line numbers come from the interpreter's own
    lexer, not from re-counting delimiters on each line in isolation.

    A multi-line f-string is not a STRING token at all on Python 3.12+ (T-1545,

    1): it is FSTRING_START, one or more FSTRING_MIDDLE segments (themselves
    possibly multi-line, and interleaved with the tokens of any interpolated
    expression), and FSTRING_END. This function tracks the whole span from
    each FSTRING_START to its matching FSTRING_END -- depth-counted so a
    nested same-quote f-string's own START/END pair does not close the outer
    span early -- rather than inspecting the interior tokens' own types,
    because an interpolated expression's tokens (a NAME, an OP) are still
    physically inside the f-string's source text and must not be read as
    code lines outside it.

    Flattening this into one `frozenset[int]` (T-1538 through T-1545) erased
    which literal a line belonged to, so two distinct literals with no blank
    line between them read as one merged block once both were in the pool

    calls this for every line except a NON-BLANK one it already knows, from a
    `.py` file's tokenize-derived multi-line-string spans, to be inside a
    Python string literal -- such a line is forced to STRING without
    consulting this function at all (see `_iter_blocks`). A BLANK line inside
    such a span is still routed through this function like any other line, so
    it classifies OTHER and breaks the block the same as a blank line
    anywhere else (T-1545; see `_iter_blocks`'s own docstring for why). A line
    consulted here is part of a textual block if it is a `//` comment (any
    indentation), a Python-quoted `//` comment line
    (`_PY_QUOTED_CPP_COMMENT_PATTERN`), or a
    bare C string-literal continuation (the shape this codebase's multi-line
    CHECK_MSG messages take: one quoted string literal per physical line).
    Anything else -- code, blank lines -- is a break between blocks, so a
    resolution marker written for one comment can never silently satisfy a
    citation in an unrelated, later block.

    This function is never consulted for a line a `.py` file's
    tokenize-derived multi-line-string span forces to STRING (T-1545) -- but
    `_iter_blocks` applies the same blank-line break to those lines directly,
    rather than merging every line inside a multi-line string into one block
    regardless of blank lines within it (the shape prior Significant 3 /
    28aa351 Significant 2 named: a resolution marker anywhere in a multi-line
    docstring or module-level string silently satisfied a citation anywhere
    else in the same string), and since T-1557 it breaks on a change of span
    membership as well, which closes the exit boundary the start-line break
    left open.

    The invariant this docstring states -- a blank line breaks a block, and a
    resolution marker in one block cannot satisfy a citation in another -- is
    asserted here in prose and PINNED in
    `test_check_present_tense_defect_comments.py`, by these cells and no
    others (T-1564, Poirot

    list: its blank line sits outside the span, so it survives every mutation
    of the blank-line rule and pins nothing. It is kept as a regression guard
    on the primary's own shape and its docstring says so.

    This pairing is deliberate: this paragraph carried the same sentence
    through four review rounds while being falsifiable in each, because a
    claim in a docstring cannot fail a build (Poirot
    b2b00b4-t1556-adjacency-fold-confirmation-2026-07-31.md, standing

    text does this ("...(Significant " / "5, closed by...)") -- is still found as
    one continuous match against the merged text, never only against one line.

    `python_string_spans`, when given, is the set of each individual literal's
    own 1-based `(start, end)` physical line range that a `.py` file's
    tokenizer places inside a multi-line STRING or f-string token
    (`_python_multiline_string_lines`) -- NOT a single flattened set of line
    numbers (T-1553): keeping each literal's own range is what lets this
    function tell a line that starts a NEW literal from a line that continues
    the one before it, even when the two are physically adjacent with no
    blank line between them. A non-blank line inside any span is forced to
    kind STRING regardless of what character it starts with, which is what
    keeps a multi-line docstring paragraph together as one block the same way
    the `//` and bare-C-string rules already keep their own multi-line shapes
    together -- without re-deriving "is a string open" from each line's own
    content the way T-1485's triple-quote-parity tracker did (see
    `_python_multiline_string_lines`'s docstring for why that desynchronised).
    `.cpp`/`.h` inputs pass `None`: C++ has no triple-quoted strings, so no
    line in a C++ file should ever force this state, and none does.

    A BLANK line inside a tokenizer-forced string span is NOT forced to
    STRING (T-1545, Poirot
    28aa351-t1544-present-tense-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 2):
    it classifies via `_line_kind` like any other line, which returns OTHER
    for it, breaking the block. Without this, every physical line inside a
    multi-line docstring or module-level string -- however many blank lines
    separate its paragraphs -- merged into ONE block, so a resolution marker
    anywhere in the string silently satisfied a citation anywhere else in
    it. This module's own module docstring was exactly such a span before
    this fix: one `closed` inside it cleared six unrelated severity-label
    citations, which is precisely what `_line_kind`'s own docstring already
    states must not happen. Forcing only non-blank lines gives a multi-line
    string paragraph-granular blocks -- one block per run of non-blank
    lines -- the same shape blank lines already produce for `//` comment
    runs and bare C string-literal continuations.

    A literal's OWN start line also closes the current block, even when the
    previous line was already kind STRING (T-1553, Poirot
    d2a7eed-t1547-present-tense-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 1):
    without this, two distinct literals with no blank line between them --
    an f-string ending on one line immediately followed by a plain
    triple-quoted string starting on the next -- read as a single block, so a
    resolution marker in the first silently satisfied an uncited citation in
    the second.

    Span MEMBERSHIP is part of block identity too, so a line inside any span
    never merges with a line outside every span (T-1557, Poirot
    b2b00b4-t1556-adjacency-fold-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 1).
    The literal-start break above is directional: it closes a block when a
    span BEGINS, and left the exit unguarded, because a single-line literal
    produces no span and therefore no start line while still classifying
    STRING through `_line_kind`. A multi-line literal immediately followed by
    a single-line string literal therefore read as one block -- the same
    defect class as T-1553, at the boundary that remedy did not reach. The
    shapes that merge ACROSS literals by design still do: single-line to
    single-line (the bare C string-literal continuation rule), quoted-`//` to
    quoted-`//` (`_PY_QUOTED_CPP_COMMENT_PATTERN`), and bare `//` to
    quoted-`//` in either order -- both classify COMMENT and the pairing is
    reachable in `.cpp`/`.h` input, though its measured reach in this tree is
    zero (T-1564, same casebook Observation). All of them sit wholly outside
    every span and so compare equal. That is why this break keys on span
    membership rather than on giving every literal a start line, which would
    split them and fire false positives across the fixture generators.

    Where two literals SHARE one physical line -- implicit or `+`
    concatenation whose first literal ends on the same line the second
    begins -- this scanner is line-granular and there is no line boundary
    between them to break at, so it cannot decompose them at all. What it
    does instead depends entirely on whether the SECOND literal is multi-line,
    and the four orderings do not behave alike (T-1562, Poirot
    83260be-t1560-span-membership-boundary-confirmation-2026-07-31.md
    Significant 1, which found the earlier text here claiming they did):

        multi-line -> multi-line   SPLITS   (loud: the second literal's own
                                             start line falls on the shared
                                             line, so the break fires INSIDE
                                             the first literal and separates
                                             its citation from its marker)
        multi-line -> single-line  MERGES   (silent)
        single-line -> multi-line  MERGES   (silent)
        single-line -> single-line MERGES   (silent)

    Only the first errs loud. **The other three are a genuine blind spot of
    this module's own defect class** -- a resolution marker in one authored
    literal satisfying an uncited citation in a different one -- and they are
    silent, which is the failure mode this module exists to prevent. They are
    not a deliberate trade-off and must not be described as one. The earlier
    text here asserted the loud behaviour for all four, which read as
    reassurance in the direction of the module being safer than it is.

    Why they are not simply fixed: a single-line literal produces no tokenize
    span and therefore no start line, so at line granularity there is nothing
    to key a break on. Closing them means decomposing a physical line into its
    constituent literals -- a sub-line rewrite of `_iter_blocks`'s whole
    contract, and a design call rather than a text fix.

    Reach, measured over the scanned tree: shared-physical-line literal pairs
    are common (high hundreds; the exact total depends on how adjacent
    literals are counted and two independent measurements disagreed on it), but
    **0 of them have a multi-line first literal** -- which both measurements
    agree on and which is the load-bearing half. So every live instance takes
    a merging path, and none currently manifests a hit (the gate is green).
    No total is quoted here on purpose: D-SLM550 retired a self-describing
    count from this same docstring for drifting, and a number two people
    derive differently is the same defect wearing a different hat. All four
    orderings are pinned by cells, so this paragraph is checkable rather than
    asserted.

    Separately, the span-exit break introduced above fires between a
    multi-line literal and a single-line literal on the FOLLOWING line, which
    is the defect shape when they are two authored messages and a **false
    positive** when they are one authored message written as implicit
    concatenation (T-1563, same casebook Minor 2). The `+` spelling was
    already flagged before this change; only the implicit spelling is new.
    Reach is zero and a false positive on a blocking gate is self-announcing,
    so it is accepted and named here rather than suppressed -- but it is a
    real behaviour change against correct, fully-cited code, and if it fires
    the fix is a line break in the source, not a suppression."""
