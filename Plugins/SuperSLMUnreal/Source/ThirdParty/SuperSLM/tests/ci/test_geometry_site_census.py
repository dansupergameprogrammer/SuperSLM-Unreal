"""Red suite for tools/geometry_site_census.py, T-2475: closes the census-exclusion class
Claude/Mendeleev/t2468-census-recommissioning-2026-08-31.md found NOT COMMISSIONED (F1,
D-SLM5603) -- `_part2_excluded_text_hit`'s substring match (`text in line`) excused the WHOLE
physical line the instant an excluded fragment's text appeared anywhere in it, so a genuinely
new, unregistered geometry-defect statement appended onto the SAME line as an already-excused
fragment was silently absorbed: PASS, exit 0, unaudited site in the tree. This is the second
instance of one class -- the first (line-keyed, T-2467) excused a whole line on a stale line
number; the second (text-keyed, this file) excused a whole line on a partial text match. Both
share the same shape: the exclusion excuses more than the thing it names.

T-2475's own property: an exclusion excuses exactly the statement it names and nothing else on
that line. `_part2_excise_excluded_text` removes the excused fragment's own text from a line
before the pattern regexes see it, rather than skipping the whole line -- new content sharing
the line, whichever side of the fragment it lands on, is left in the remainder and scanned like
ordinary code. `model.h`'s and `proof_manifest.h`'s own `_PART2_EXCLUDED_TEXT` fragments were
widened from a uniqueness-only prefix (the enumerator name alone) to their own full stripped
line, because their trailing explanatory comment -- not the enumerator declaration -- is what
actually trips `_r1_multiply_hit`; excising only the prefix would have left that comment's own
hidden_size/head_dim/num_attention_heads/`*` text in the remainder and turned the untouched
baseline red.

Structure, in the order `StandardsDocument.md` Sec4/Sec5.4 requires (population derived and
verified at source before the mechanism was built, mechanism built, population reproduced
against the built mechanism):

  - Mechanism cells (`test_excise_*`): `_part2_excise_excluded_text` in isolation, synthetic
    lines, no file I/O -- proves the excision itself, independent of the real tree.
  - Real-tree population cells, against the REAL checkout via `_mutated` (mutate one real
    production file for the duration of one test, restore its exact original bytes after --
    this module imports `census` ONCE, at collection time, so `census._REGISTRY_PATH` is bound
    to this repo's own `tools/` directory for every call in this file; calling
    `census.run_census(tmp_root)` against a synthetic tmp tree would still load THIS repo's real
    registry, mismatched against the tmp tree's own paths, not a copy of it -- a fresh subprocess
    invoking a copy of `tools/` alongside a copy of `src/`/`include/` genuinely does carry its own
    registry (Claude/Poirot/dcefab3-t2486-census-content-keying-confirmation.md's own lab does
    exactly this), which this suite does not use because every cell here calls the already-
    imported module in-process; mirrors T-2468's own mutate/run/revert discipline):
      * `test_real_tree_baseline_is_clean_today` -- cell zero, unmutated.
      * `test_must_accept_*` (T-2468 Sec1, D-SLM5601) -- comment inserted above each of the
        three excluded lines; must stay PASS (position-independence, unaffected by this fix).
      * `test_must_reject_*` (T-2468 Sec2, D-SLM5602) -- a genuinely new, unregistered site in
        a zero-marker production header; must FAIL and cite the injected line.
      * `test_defeats_the_prior_mechanism_*` (T-2468 Sec3, D-SLM5603 -- THE finding this ticket
        closes) -- a genuinely new statement appended onto the SAME physical line as an
        already-excused fragment, on each of the three exclusions; must now FAIL (was PASS
        under `_part2_excluded_text_hit`).
      * `test_prepended_content_on_an_excused_line_is_also_caught` -- this ticket's own added
        construction: new content BEFORE the fragment, not just after -- the excise-and-scan
        property is symmetric, unlike a hypothetical "only widen at the end" remedy.
      * `test_safe_direction_rename_and_reformat_*` (T-2468 Sec4a cases 1-2, D-SLM5604) -- the
        brief's own named safe-direction Note: renaming or reformatting the excused line itself
        still re-triggers the census (a real cost, not a hole a defect can hide in). Confirms
        this fix does not make the exclusion stickier.
      * `test_wrap_comment_split_is_now_reported_as_a_dead_exclusion_not_a_silent_pass` (T-2468
        Sec4a case 3, reclassified by T-2475's own fragment-widening + dead-entry check) --
        splitting the excused declaration from its own comment removes the pattern-triggering
        co-occurrence entirely AND breaks the widened fragment's exact-text match; the case is
        no longer a silent, uninformative PASS -- it is now a named DEAD EXCLUSION finding.
      * `test_two_line_split_is_the_documented_f2_limitation_still_open` (T-2468 Sec4a case 4,
        F2) -- a genuinely new QOW site split across two physical lines still evades Part 2;
        pre-existing, not this ticket's own diff (Part 2's per-line hit detection is unchanged),
        reproduced here so the PASS this case still returns is a proven, not assumed, fact, and
        cross-checked against the KNOWN LIMITATION text `main()` now prints.

T-2481 fold-in (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2481.md; Claude/Mendeleev/t2480-census-recommissioning-
2026-08-31.md F1, D-SLM5647/D-SLM5659; Claude/Poirot/f363c2a-t2479-census-class-confirmation.md
Significant 1/2, D-SLM5651/D-SLM5652): four sources bundled into one round --

  - Part 3's occurrence-ordinal keying is defeated by REORDERING two existing occurrences of a
    same-file, multi-occurrence site -- nothing added or removed, marker count unchanged, Part 1
    blind to it -- which desyncs the ordinal-to-offset lookup and silently absorbs a genuine
    revert while citing an untouched line (`test_part3_reorder_*`, below). Replaced with
    CONTENT-ADDRESSED occurrence identification (`required_token_scopes`, registry) -- see
    `tools/geometry_site_census.py`'s own Part 3 header comment and the registry's own header
    comment for the full account.
  - Part 2's exclusion mechanism excuses EVERY literal copy of an excused fragment in its own
    file, not only the one statement it names -- a genuinely new, unregistered site written as a
    literal copy of an excused statement is excised for free (`test_part2_ambiguous_exclusion_*`,
    below). Closed by counting non-comment-line matches instead of recording mere presence.
  - Two of the four cells pinning T-2475's own headline remedy exercised text a compiler never
    sees (append AFTER a fragment's own trailing `//` comment); the two prior cells renamed to
    state precisely what they do prove (a dead exclusion, not a caught defect statement). T-2481
    also added two cells over what it believed was the producible shape for these two files
    (insert BEFORE the trailing comment) -- corrected below, T-2491: it is not producible.
  - The S2 red-check comment block's own cell count ("exactly four") is corrected to what a
    full, unfiltered run of this file actually reddens under the same reversion.

T-2491 fold-in (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2491.md; Claude/Poirot/dcefab3-t2486-census-content-keying-
confirmation.md Significant 1/2, D-SLM5716/D-SLM5717/D-SLM5718; D-SLM5732): fix round on T-2486's
confirmation of T-2481's diff --

  - T-2481's own `test_defeats_the_prior_mechanism_same_line_insert_before_comment_model_h`/
    `_proof_manifest_h` were believed to pin the producible same-line shape for `model.h` and
    `proof_manifest.h`. Both excused lines are enumerators inside an `enum class` body
    (`SslmModelStatus`, `ConfigGeometryStatus`); an enum body admits enumerators, not statements,
    so the construction does not compile -- executed with the CI's own pinned compiler, clang
    18.1.8, `-fsyntax-only -std=c++20`: `error: missing ',' between enumerators` on both headers.
    The cells also have zero discrimination, executed both with the QOW family forced false and
    with the injected identifier replaced by an inert statement: the assertion still holds either
    way, because what actually fires is the trailing prose comment's own R1 co-occurrence once
    the exclusion's exact-text match goes dead, not recognition of the injected statement. Deleted
    rather than replaced with a third attempt at the SAME shape.

    T-2491's own replacement text (D-SLM5732, D-SLM5740) went further than the compile finding
    supports: "there is no producible same-line geometry defect an enum body can host." Refuted
    by construction (Claude/Poirot/ba29de4-t2496-census-fixes-confirmation.md Significant 1,
    D-SLM5756/D-SLM5757): an enum body admits enumerators, not statements, but a same-line
    ENUMERATOR prepend is both legal C++ and enough. Because the excused fragment is the whole
    stripped line, a prepend leaves it intact -- the exclusion still fires and the injected text
    is scanned as ordinary remainder. Executed at the CI's pinned compiler, clang 18.1.8,
    `-fsyntax-only -std=c++20`: `q_proj_out_channels_hidden_size, ` prepended to `model.h`'s
    fragment and `o_proj_out_channels_hidden_size, ` prepended to `proof_manifest.h`'s both
    compile clean and fire `UNMARKED QOW PATTERN HIT`, discriminating both ways (silent with the
    QOW family disabled, silent with an inert enumerator in place of the defect). T-2497 adds one
    cell per header (`test_defeats_the_prior_mechanism_same_line_enumerator_prepend_model_h`/
    `_proof_manifest_h`, below) pinning exactly this. The corrected, narrower fact: a same-line
    *statement* is not producible inside an `enum class` body; a same-line *enumerator* is, and
    the census catches it. `adapter_marshal.h`'s excused line sits inside a function body, where
    both statement forms (`..._append_adapter_marshal`/
    `test_prepended_content_on_an_excused_line_is_also_caught`, below) are real.
  - `test_part3_missing_scopes_entry_is_reported_when_a_fixed_site_has_no_registry_record_at_all`
    restored `tools/geometry_site_registry.json` via `open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8")`, which
    translates `\\n` to `\\r\\n` on this platform; the file is `attr/text eol=lf`, so a clean
    checkout came back `w/crlf` and ` M` after one run. Fixed with `newline=""` on both the write
    and the restore. `_mutated`, below, is hardened the same round -- not with a blanket
    `newline=""` (every `.h`/`.cpp`/`.hlsl` file it mutates is `attr/text`, checked out CRLF, and
    an unconditional `newline=""` would restore those as LF instead, the same defect in the other
    direction), but by detecting each target file's own newline convention from its raw bytes
    before writing, so the next `eol=lf` file it is pointed at inherits the correct behavior.
  - `AMBIGUOUS SCOPE ANCHOR` (Part 3's third fail-closed diagnostic) had no cell -- pinned by
    `test_part3_ambiguous_scope_anchor_fires_when_two_records_own_anchors_collide_in_one_window`,
    below, reproducing the reviewer's own construction.
  - GS-12's own nine occurrences are anchored on their own explanatory COMMENT text (this file's
    own Part 3 header comment explains why: a bare code prefix collided with unrelated, unmarked
    code once a reorder moved it), so the match key includes comment prose for all nine of GS-12's
    occurrences, through eight registered records (two occurrences, `occ2`/`occ7`, share one
    record -- see the registry's own header comment) -- a developer who rewords one of those
    comments, no code touched, reddens the
    census with `MISSING SCOPE ANCHOR` (Claude/Poirot/dcefab3-t2486-census-content-keying-
    confirmation.md Sec7 O2, D-SLM5726, executed: "the normed" to "the normalised" in one GS-12
    comment). This was disclosed nowhere a reader of the tool would find it; disclosed now in
    `tools/geometry_site_census.py`'s own Part 3 header comment and the registry's own header
    comment, both of which also say the correct response to that red: re-derive the occurrence's
    own anchor from the new comment text, not treat the finding as a caught regression.
  - This module's own docstring (below) and the S2 red-check comment block (further down this
    file) each carried a stale claim untouched by T-2481's diff -- corrected in place rather than
    superseded a third time; see each site's own comment for what was wrong and how it was
    checked.

T-2497 fold-in (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2497.md; Claude/Poirot/ba29de4-t2496-census-fixes-
confirmation.md Significant 1/2, D-SLM5756/D-SLM5757/D-SLM5758): fix round on T-2496's
confirmation of T-2491's diff --

  - T-2491's own replacement fact for the two deleted pins -- "there is no producible same-line
    geometry defect an enum body can host" -- overclaimed. Refuted by construction: an enum body
    admits enumerators, not statements, but a same-line ENUMERATOR prepend is legal C++, compiles
    clean at the CI's pinned compiler, and fires the census from the excused fragment's own
    remainder. Two cells restore what the deletion left uncovered
    (`test_defeats_the_prior_mechanism_same_line_enumerator_prepend_model_h`/
    `_proof_manifest_h`, below); the corrected, narrower fact -- a same-line statement is not
    producible inside an enum class body, a same-line enumerator is, and is caught -- replaces
    the overclaim at every site it reached (this docstring, the S2 red-check comment block, both
    T-2481/T-2491 build logs, and D-SLM5732/D-SLM5740).
  - Neither production change T-2491 made is detectable by any cell in this file: reverting
    `newline=""` on `test_part3_missing_scopes_entry_is_reported_when_a_fixed_site_has_no_
    registry_record_at_all`'s own registry write still passes while the registry's own bytes
    change underneath it, and reverting `_mutated`'s convention-detection hardening leaves this
    whole file green. `_mutated_targets_and_registry_are_byte_identical_after_the_module_runs`,
    below, is a module-scoped, autouse fixture that snapshots the `_mutated` targets plus
    the registry before this module's own suite runs and asserts them byte-identical after --
    closing both halves of the dirty-checkout class at once, for the paths
    `_MUTATED_TARGETS_AND_REGISTRY_PATHS` names (T-2526: no count restated here -- see that
    tuple's own comment for why).

T-2499 fold-in (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2499.md; Claude/Poirot/bc2ae29-t2498-census-fixes-
confirmation.md Significant 1/2, D-SLM5775/D-SLM5776): fix round on T-2498's confirmation of
T-2497's diff --

  - `test_oracle_header_commit_count_pin_matches_the_prose_word`'s own remedy (T-2497) removed
    the only detection of the class it replaced: the oracle header's `COMMIT_COUNT_PIN` and prose
    word can drift together from the file's own true history with that cell green throughout,
    executed (a comment-only commit to the oracle, neither number updated: a full-history `git
    log --follow` gives 16 where both the prose word and the pin still read 15). Restored by
    `test_oracle_header_commit_count_matches_git_log_follow_on_a_full_history_checkout` in
    `test_membership_check_population.py`, guarded on `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` the
    same way `tools/ci/check_abi_header_inventory.py` degrades when its own population source is
    unavailable -- skips explicitly on a shallow checkout (never expected to run in CI), runs and
    catches the drift on every developer's own full-history checkout.
  - The T-2497 fold-in bullet immediately above overclaimed the byte-identity fixture's own
    scope: "every future cell that touches the real tree" is false as implemented -- executed, a
    cell writing `include/superslm/forward_sites.h` without restoring gives `41 passed`, fixture
    silent, file left modified, because that path was never in
    `_MUTATED_TARGETS_AND_REGISTRY_PATHS`. The claim is narrowed to what the fixture actually
    guarantees (its own docstring, below, and the comment above the tuple) -- exactly the paths
    `_MUTATED_TARGETS_AND_REGISTRY_PATHS` names, no more. The tuple's own `src/` entries, formerly
    duplicated as separate `os.path.join(...)` literals 430-odd lines below the tuple, are replaced
    with references to `_PROOF_MANIFEST_CPP`/`_SUPERSLM_GPU_CPP`, moved up and defined once, so the
    two spellings cannot desync.
  - `derive_bad_alloc_membership.py`'s `git_log_follow_commit_count` and its `--commit-count` CLI
    branch (T-2497) had no cell; `test_membership_check_population.py`'s `--oracle` mode is
    deliberately pinned through the real subprocess CLI path rather than called in-process, with
    the reason written down, and this round follows that same precedent for `--commit-count`.
  - The item-3 sweep (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2499.md; every production change landed by T-2491,
    T-2497, and this round, checked against a detecting cell) found `_mutated`'s own newline-
    convention branch (T-2491) genuinely undetectable by anything in this suite -- every real
    `_mutated` target is pure CRLF today, so the branch has never been exercised on an `eol=lf`
    input. Cheap to close: extracted into its own pure function, `_write_newline_for`, pinned
    directly on synthetic bytes by `test_write_newline_for_picks_the_convention_from_raw_bytes`,
    below, with no real file and no new `eol=lf` fixture added to the repo.

T-2518 fold-in (Claude/Bach/briefs/t2518-census-ci-regression-fix.md; Claude/Poirot/a3a20bc-
t2509-adapter-geometry-review.md Critical 1, D-SLM5857): fix round on T-2509's own diff, which
rewrote `tools/geometry_site_census.py` (the T-2509 widening -- see the module docstring's own
"WIDENED T-2509" note) and fixed BOTH of adapter_marshal.h's own geometry defects (GS-28, GS-29)
without running this file, reddening 13 of its then-41 cells --

  - `_ADAPTER_FRAGMENT`/`_MODEL_FRAGMENT` (module-level constants, above) named text that no
    longer exists: T-2509 fixed adapter_marshal.h's own q_proj/o_proj residual (the exact excused
    line these constants pinned is deleted, replaced by real per-projection branches, registered
    and marked instead of excused) and restructured model.h's ConfigGeometryHiddenSizeMismatch
    comment so `head_dim` no longer shares a physical line with `hidden_size` there either --
    `_PART2_EXCLUDED_TEXT` (census.py) no longer carries an entry for either file. Every cell
    built on `_ADAPTER_FRAGMENT`/`_MODEL_FRAGMENT` either raised constructing its own fixture (an
    internal `assert ... == 1` uniqueness check against text no longer present) or silently
    no-opped (mutated nothing, asserted against an unmutated tree) -- ten cells across the
    excise-mechanism, must-accept, same-line-append, enumerator-prepend, prepended-content,
    safe-direction, dead-exclusion, and ambiguous-exclusion populations. Each population's own
    adapter_marshal.h and/or model.h member is DELETED (ten cells; see each section's own header
    comment, at the site of its own deletion, for the specific account) rather than retargeted at
    a synthetic (path, text) pair invented for the sole purpose of keeping the cell count
    unchanged -- this module's own standard (above, "population derived and verified at source
    before the mechanism was built") is that a construction is grounded in the real tree, not
    fabricated to exercise a mechanism in the abstract, and neither file has a real, compilable
    subject left for any of these shapes. All ten are genuinely absent from the tip file -- none
    is retargeted. Five SURVIVING cells, never among the ten, are separately retargeted onto
    `proof_manifest.h` (that file's own exclusion is untouched by T-2509 and still live, so the
    underlying property each proves -- one member of the excise-mechanism population
    (`test_excise_does_not_touch_an_unrelated_line_in_a_registered_file`), both members of the
    safe-direction population (`test_safe_direction_rename_of_the_excused_enumerator_reddens`,
    `test_safe_direction_reformat_of_the_excused_line_reddens`), one member of the dead-exclusion
    population (`test_dead_exclusion_is_reported_when_its_subject_is_deleted`), and one member of
    the ambiguous-exclusion population (`test_part2_ambiguous_exclusion_fires_on_a_literal_
    duplicate_copy`) -- still has a real subject and is still proven, just against the one file
    where it remains true). One cell (`test_two_line_split_is_the_documented_f2_limitation_still_
    open`) is SPLIT in two rather than deleted or retargeted: T-2509's own window widening is
    QOW-only, deliberately (census.py's own comment above the window loop), so half of what this
    cell's own construction proved -- the QOW-shaped two-line split -- now FAILS the census where
    it used to PASS, while the other half (an R1-shaped two-line split, a new construction this
    round adds) is still NOT caught, exactly as documented. Net (name-diffed against the tip file:
    11 removed, 2 added, 30 kept): ten deletions, one two-way split, thirty-two cells passing (was
    forty-one; thirty kept plus the split's own two halves).

    T-2524 correction (Poirot e4bcaeb-t2518-census-fix-confirmation.md Minor 1, D-SLM5883): the
    paragraph above originally said "29 pre-existing plus the new R1 cell" (= 30, not 32) and
    named "four of the ten ... RETARGETED onto proof_manifest.h" as must-accept/dead-exclusion/
    ambiguous-exclusion/safe-direction -- both wrong, checked at source: no deleted cell is
    retargeted, the five retargets above are all SURVIVING cells, must-accept's own two
    non-`proof_manifest.h` members are among the ten DELETED (not retargeted) with its
    `proof_manifest.h` member simply untouched, and the excise-mechanism population (omitted from
    the original four) has one retarget of its own. Two of the ten -- `test_excise_leaves_
    appended_new_content_in_the_remainder` and `test_excise_leaves_prepended_new_content_in_the_
    remainder` -- are additionally RESTORED (not merely corrected in the account): see the
    mechanism-cells section's own header comment, above, for why they were deleted in error.
  - Poirot's own Significant 1 (`include/superslm/model.h`'s ConfigGeometryHiddenSizeMismatch
    comment falsely claims "UNREACHABLE, no live producer returns this" when four `src/model.cpp`
    returns are live) is fixed in place: the two clauses T-2509 dropped while copying
    `proof_manifest.h`'s own already-correct form are restored, verified by execution to leave
    the census unaffected (head_dim/the multiply still sit on the comment-only continuation line,
    exactly as before this fix).
  - Poirot's own Significant 2 (the fix's own two new construction sites, GS-32/GS-33, are
    registered `confirmed-correct` -- carrying no `required_tokens` -- so Part 3 never checks
    them, and reverting either to the pre-fix `q_width = hidden_size` defect leaves the census
    PASSing) is fixed per Poirot's own routed, execution-verified remedy: both flipped to
    `status: "fixed"` with `required_tokens: ["num_attention_heads"]` and a null-anchor,
    offset-6 `required_token_scopes` record for their own file. Verified by construction: reverting
    either site's own `q_width` computation to `bc.hidden_size`/`model->hidden_size` now fails the
    census with `REGRESSED SITE`, restored clean.
  - Poirot's own Significant 3 (the window's own doc comment claims a comment-only line is "not
    counted toward window width" -- false; it is skipped from the JOINED text but still consumes
    one of the window's own `_WINDOW_SIZE` physical-line slots, so `_WINDOW_SIZE` or more
    intervening comment lines between a real co-occurrence's two halves are not reached) is
    corrected in place (census.py's own comment above the window loop) -- a documentation fix,
    the second of Poirot's own two offered remedies, folded into the same PASS-line KNOWN
    LIMITATION disclosure S4 below already needed.
  - Poirot's own Significant 4 (the PASS line claims the T-2468 F2 limitation is closed whole; it
    is closed only for QOW, and the R1 half is exactly as open as before) is corrected: the PASS
    line (census.py's own `main()`) now states what closed (QOW, across physical lines) and what
    did not (R1, still single-physical-line only; and Significant 3's own comment-width bound),
    on the PASS line itself, not only in the docstring -- matching the two-way split above.
  - Poirot's own Minor 1 (the window check tests only whether its own START line already produced
    a single-line hit, so a single-line hit at `i+1` is re-reported a second time by a window
    starting at `i`) is fixed: the window loop (census.py) now skips any window whose own SPAN
    contains a single-line hit anywhere in it, verified by construction (a minimal probe: one
    QOW-shaped statement now produces exactly one finding, not two).
  - Poirot's own Minor 2 (the `_OUT_CHANNELS_RE` comment claims every genuine `out_channels` use
    tree-wide is a bare identifier -- false; prefixed identifiers exist tree-wide) is corrected:
    the comment (census.py, above `_OUT_CHANNELS_RE`) now states the narrower, verified-true claim
    the tightening actually rests on (no CODE line in Part 2's own swept scope pairs `hidden_size`
    with a prefixed `*_out_channels`), independently re-verified by grep and by a direct sweep of
    the swept scope. The exact per-identifier count is not restated here -- see census.py's own
    comment for the current figure and its disclosed classifier; T-2524 (Poirot e4bcaeb-t2518-
    census-fix-confirmation.md Minor 2, D-SLM5883) found this bullet's own prior restatement of
    that count already stale at the commit that carried it, which is the drift this indirection
    is meant to stop recurring.
  - Poirot's own Minor 3 (`tools/t2113_b6b_adapter_delta_smoke.cpp`'s own `StepCpu` loads an
    adapter at `q_width` but calls `RunLayerLoop` without threading `q_width` through, taking the
    `= 0` default that resolves to `effective_q_width = hidden_size` -- an under-read on a
    non-square artifact) is fixed: `StepCpu` now takes and threads `q_width` (both call sites pass
    `base_geom.q_width`, the same construction the loader already uses), verified to compile
    clean at the CI's own pinned compiler (clang 18.1.8, `-fsyntax-only -std=c++20`).
  - Poirot's own Observation 1 (a merged window group's coverage is checked only at its own start
    line, so a group longer than `_covered`'s own +-25-line marker window with a covered start but
    an uncovered end would be suppressed -- no live instance today, all 20 real groups measured
    span <=12 lines and are covered at both ends) is closed on sight, per this file's own
    established convention of closing a cheap gap rather than filing a note for one: the check
    (census.py) now reads `_covered(group_start) or _covered(group_end)`.

    T-2524 correction (Poirot e4bcaeb-t2518-census-fix-confirmation.md Significant 1, D-SLM5880):
    the expression above is INVERTED -- it emits only when NEITHER end is covered, which is a
    strict narrowing of the old single-end check, not the superset this bullet's own stated intent
    describes. Executed on the real tree: four measured gaps where `or` suppresses a genuine
    finding the pre-T-2518 code used to report, and the (covered start, uncovered end) case this
    Observation names is still missed. Corrected to `_covered(group_start) and _covered(group_end)`
    (census.py) -- emit unless BOTH ends are covered, the superset the bullet above always intended.
  - D-SLM5859 (the census sweeps `.worktrees`, so its result depends on which checkout it is
    invoked from -- `D:/SuperSLM` itself holds roughly sixty nested full-source checkouts under
    its own `.worktrees` directory) is fixed rather than deferred: `.worktrees` is added to
    `_SKIP_DIR_NAMES` (census.py), the same mechanism that already excludes `.git`/`out`/`build`.
    Verified by construction: invoking the fixed census with `--repo-root D:/SuperSLM` sweeps 446
    files (none under `.worktrees`) in 0.15s, where the unfixed script measured 212.17s and a
    result that depended on caller cwd.

def _write_newline_for(raw_bytes: bytes) -> str:
    """T-2491 (Poirot dcefab3-t2486-census-content-keying-confirmation.md Significant 2,
    D-SLM5718), extracted as its own pure function by T-2499 (Claude/Poirot/bc2ae29-t2498-census-
    fixes-confirmation.md item 3 sweep, D-SLM5778): picks the `open(..., newline=...)` argument
    that reproduces a file's own newline convention on write-back, from that file's own raw bytes
    rather than from its extension or the platform default. `.h`/`.cpp`/`.hlsl` files are
    `attr/text` (tool-native, `w/crlf` on this checkout) and the platform-default write already
    reproduced that -- the defect this closes is an `attr/text eol=lf` file (e.g. the JSON
    registry): the platform-default write translates every `\\n` to `\\r\\n` regardless of the
    file's own pinned convention, so a byte-for-byte restore of an eol=lf file silently comes back
    CRLF.

    Pulled out of `_mutated`, below, so this branch can be pinned directly on synthetic bytes
    (`test_write_newline_for_picks_the_convention_from_raw_bytes`) rather than only through a real
    repo file. T-2526 (Poirot 96abd9e-t2524-census-confirmation2.md Minor 1, D-SLM5899) widened
    `tools/geometry_site_registry.json` -- `attr/text eol=lf`, genuinely LF on disk (confirmed by
    direct execution, T-2531) -- from a directly-written path into a real `_mutated` target too,
    so this function's own eol=lf branch IS now exercised through the real tree by two cells
    (`test_part2_window_group_covered_start_uncovered_end_is_still_reported` and its sibling,
    below).

    What `Claude/Poirot/ba29de4-t2496-census-fixes-confirmation.md` Sec7 (D-SLM5758) measured, on
    this Windows/CRLF checkout, is BOTH of `_mutated`'s writes reverted to the platform default --
    `open(full, "w", encoding="utf-8")`, no `newline=` argument, not a blanket `newline=""` --
    leaving the whole file green and the regression undetected (Claude/Poirot/
    ed0c67d-t2502-census-fixes-confirmation.md Significant 2, D-SLM5785). T-2499's extraction of
    this function did NOT close that finding, whatever the module's own prose once claimed
    (Claude/Poirot/5e128ee-t2530-superslm-ci-green-review.md C-1, D-SLM5936): a second, separate
    writer --
    `test_part3_missing_scopes_entry_is_reported_when_a_fixed_site_has_no_registry_record_at_all`
    (below) hand-rolled its own hardcoded `newline=""` against this same registry path instead of
    calling this function, and that cell's own still-correct write, running after the two
    window-group cells corrupt the registry through a REVERTED `_mutated`, silently restored the
    checkout to its correct bytes as a side effect of its own teardown -- so the module-scoped
    `_mutated_targets_and_registry_are_byte_identical_after_the_module_runs` fixture never saw a
    mismatch, and the regression stayed undetectable end to end (reproduced by direct execution,
    T-2531: reverting `_mutated`'s `newline=_write_newline` argument with that cell unchanged left
    the FULL module at 39 passed, 0 failed). T-2531 routed that cell through `_mutated` too, so
    every real-tree write in this module decides its newline convention through this ONE
    function.

    T-2533 correction (Poirot 4187739-t2532-superslm-ci-green-confirmation.md C-1n): the closure
    claim T-2531 wrote here -- "the byte-identity fixture fires regardless of which cell happens
    to run last" -- is FALSE as an unqualified statement, and D-SLM5944 recorded the same false
    breadth. Executed both ways, on byte-preserved trees: on a CRLF checkout the identical revert
    still fails the module (`39 passed, 1 error`, byte mismatch on
    `tools/geometry_site_registry.json`); on a genuine LF checkout -- built by cloning this repo
    fresh into WSL/Ubuntu, matching every `ubuntu-latest` CI job that runs this module -- the
    IDENTICAL revert leaves `39 passed, 0 failed`: `tools/geometry_site_registry.json` is already
    LF there, Linux's own platform default is also LF, and a platform-default write to it is a
    no-op, so the real tree has nothing left to discriminate. The call-site regression D-SLM5785/
    D-SLM5758 name is real and stays undetectable by any REAL-TREE cell in this module on the
    platform every CI job that runs it actually uses.

    Closed for that platform by `test_mutated_call_site_preserves_a_forced_crlf_file_regardless_
    of_checkout_platform` (below): a synthetic scratch file carrying FORCED CRLF bytes, outside
    `_MUTATED_TARGETS_AND_REGISTRY_PATHS` and independent of the real tree's own OS-dependent

#
# T-2518 (Claude/Poirot/a3a20bc-t2509-adapter-geometry-review.md Critical 1): this section, and
# the population below it, used to carry cells keyed on `_ADAPTER_H`/`_ADAPTER_FRAGMENT` and

# `test_excise_leaves_appended_new_content_in_the_remainder`,
# `test_excise_leaves_prepended_new_content_in_the_remainder`, and
# `test_excise_removes_the_full_widened_model_h_fragment_including_its_own_comment`. T-2509 fixed
# BOTH residuals these cells' own subjects named (adapter_marshal.h's AdapterOutChannelsFor q_proj
# branch, GS-29; and restructured model.h's ConfigGeometryHiddenSizeMismatch comment so head_dim
# no longer shares a physical line with hidden_size there) -- `_PART2_EXCLUDED_TEXT` no longer
# carries an entry for either file (module docstring's own "WIDENED T-2509" note; census.py's own
# header comment above `_PART2_EXCLUDED_TEXT`), so `_ADAPTER_FRAGMENT`/`_MODEL_FRAGMENT` no longer
# match anything in the real tree. T-2518 deleted all four rather than retargeting any of them.
#
# T-2524 correction (Poirot e4bcaeb-t2518-census-fix-confirmation.md Significant 2, D-SLM5881):
# that reasoning does not hold for two of the four. `test_excise_removes_the_adapter_marshal_
# fragment_entirely` and `test_excise_removes_the_full_widened_model_h_fragment_including_its_
# own_comment` call `_part2_excise_excluded_text` against each file's OWN fragment constant -- once
# neither fragment exists in the tree, both silently no-op (mutate nothing, assert against an
# unmutated tree) and are correctly deleted; `test_excise_removes_the_adapter_marshal_fragment_
# entirely` additionally adds nothing even retargeted (a whole-line skip also removes the fragment
# outright, so it does not discriminate from the surviving `..._proof_manifest_h_fragment_
# including_its_own_comment` cell below). But `test_excise_leaves_appended_new_content_in_the_
# remainder` and `test_excise_leaves_prepended_new_content_in_the_remainder` call
# `_part2_excise_excluded_text(path, line)` on a SYNTHETIC STRING LITERAL -- they never touch the
# tree and never needed a compilable subject, only a REGISTERED path, which `proof_manifest.h`
# still is. Restored below, retargeted onto `_PROOF_H`/`_PROOF_FRAGMENT` -- executed: pass on the
# clean tree, and BOTH fail under `_part2_excise_excluded_text` reverted to skip-whole-line-on-
# match, the mutation this file's own S2 red-check comment block (further down this file) exists
# to measure. These two are the excise mechanism's only UNIT-LEVEL pins for "new content sharing
# an excused line is left in the remainder" -- the surviving end-to-end population further down
# this file (`test_appending_after_proof_manifest_h_s_trailing_comment_fires_on_apparatus_unsound_
# grounds`, `test_defeats_the_prior_mechanism_same_line_enumerator_prepend_proof_manifest_h`) both
# depend on `proof_manifest.h` still carrying a live exclusion, one edit away from having no
# subject left at all -- these two take their input as an argument instead, and do not.
