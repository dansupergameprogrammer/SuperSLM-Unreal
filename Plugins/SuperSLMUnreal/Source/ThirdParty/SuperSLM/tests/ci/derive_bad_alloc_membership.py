"""Independent reference derivation of the "throws only std::bad_alloc"
contract's membership population (S-HARDEN-7, F5; Claude/Vitruvius/
SuperSLM_SHARDEN678_Bundle_Design-2026-07-23.md Sec3.1's corrected,
four-condition rule; T-411).

This is Curie's independent second read of Sec3.1's rule -- adapted from the
adversary's four probe scripts (Claude/Loki/superslm-sharden678-bundle-
strike-2026-07-23-probe-*), which implemented the rule's PRIOR, three-
condition form (the one the strike proved TU-dependent) and derived 12/13/14
depending on scan strategy. This module extends that same walk with the two
conditions the fold that closed the strike added:

  - condition 2 (new): exclude the enclosing class's own copy constructor,
    move constructor, copy-assignment operator, and move-assignment operator
    by a STRUCTURAL test (enclosing class name + the one parameter's stripped
    type), tested before the noexcept test -- this is what makes the
    population independent of which translation unit happens to be scanned
    (design Sec3.1, "fourth-pass" fold).
  - condition 4(b) (new): admit any function whose return type is
    `std::string` or `std::vector<T>`, regardless of parameter shape --
    closes the promise/rule scope mismatch the strike surveyed but did not
    prosecute (Sec6 of the strike record).

Per StandardsDocument Sec4: "a new structure is validated against an
independently-found population before it is trusted." The four Loki probes
ARE that independently-found population for the prior rule; this module
re-derives the population under the CORRECTED rule and this package's own
test suite (test_membership_check_population.py) confirms it reproduces the
mechanically-derived population -- twenty as of T-2125
(SslmAmplifyingFoldScaleView<Kind>::Parse joined the nineteen T-1475 left
behind, JsonEscape's own promotion into proof_manifest.h; design Sec3.1's
table itself still states eighteen and is owed a matching amendment;
tests/ci/bad_alloc_membership_expected.txt is this population's own current
source of truth) -- from the real headers on disk, under three independent
scan strategies: the direct re-run of the property the strike found false of
the prior rule.

This is a REFERENCE tool, not the CI gate. The CI gate itself
(design Sec3.1: "tools/ci/check_bad_alloc_contract.py or the build seat's
equivalent placement") is the build seat's production infrastructure -- step
2 of the design's own three-step gate (derive membership; check wrapping;
fail naming every unwrapped member) is unbuildable until each site is
wrapped. This module implements only step 1 (derive membership), as the
oracle the CI gate's own step-1 output must match once built.

Invokes `clang++ -Xclang -ast-dump=json` as a subprocess per scan (no AST
dump is ever written to a tracked file -- a single header's dump is on the
order of 100+ MB of JSON, and the point of this module is that the dump is
reproducible from the headers on demand, not that a snapshot of it is
committed). Requires a clang++ capable of `-Xclang -ast-dump=json` (pinned
per design Sec3.1: ships pre-installed on GitHub's stock `ubuntu-latest`
runner image, which sets SUPERSLM_CLANGXX explicitly; locally,
_clang_discovery.discover_clangxx() finds one on PATH or in a short list of
known install locations without anyone setting the variable -- set
SUPERSLM_CLANGXX to an explicit path only to override that discovery,

    CORRECTED (T-2125 fix round, Poirot 242dc12-t2125-ci-drift-review.md,
    Significant 4): a class TEMPLATE's own member surfaces once per
    `ClassTemplateSpecializationDecl` Clang emits for it -- one per implicit
    instantiation the scanned headers reference (`SslmAmplifyingFoldScaleView
    <Delta>`, `SslmAmplifyingFoldScaleView<U>`, and the primary template's own
    declaration) -- and each instantiation's `type` field carries the
    substituted `Kind`, so a key that includes `type` stops deduplicating for
    exactly a template member and grows by one entry per additional `Kind`
    enumerator with no soundness reason to. `(header, line, name)` is this
    function's own dedup key -- it is what makes each of model.h's three
    distinct `Parse` overloads survive dedup as three separate members rather
    than collapsing to one, which is exactly the property the oracle's own
    `(header, name)` MULTISET (see `format_oracle_lines`, below) depends on to
    detect a same-named member joining -- a third, in the way T-2125's real
    one did; dropping `type` from the dedup key (not `line`) makes the LIST
    length this function returns match the population's true size instead of
    counting every template instantiation.

    """T-2497 (Claude/Poirot/ba29de4-t2496-census-fixes-confirmation.md Critical 1, D-SLM5755):
    moved here from `test_membership_check_population.py`, where it was called by a pytest cell
    collected by CI's own `pytest tests/ci/ -v` step. `git log --follow` is a property of the
    CLONE, not of this file: `actions/checkout@v5` defaults to a depth-1 clone and no job in
    `.github/workflows/` sets `fetch-depth`, so that cell read one commit instead of fourteen and
    fails on every Actions checkout, reproduced on a local depth-1 clone (T-2499, Claude/Poirot/
    bc2ae29-t2498-census-fixes-confirmation.md Minor 1, D-SLM5779: the branch carrying that cell
    was never pushed, so it never actually ran on a runner). This function was made to run ONLY
    when a human invokes this module directly with `--commit-count`, on their own full-history
    checkout, at REGENERATION time -- never from a CI-collected test. The result is meant to be
    pasted into `tests/ci/bad_alloc_membership_expected.txt`'s own header, both into the prose
    sentence that states it in words and into the `COMMIT_COUNT_PIN:` line beneath it, together,
    by hand -- see that file's own header comment for the pinned-value check this replaces the
    live git call with.

    T-2499 (Claude/Poirot/bc2ae29-t2498-census-fixes-confirmation.md Significant 1, D-SLM5775):
    that restriction is narrowed, not repealed. `test_membership_check_population.py`'s
    `test_oracle_header_commit_count_matches_git_log_follow_on_a_full_history_checkout` DOES call
    this function from a CI-collected cell -- but only after `git rev-parse
    --is-shallow-repository` confirms the checkout has full history, which no `actions/checkout`
    default clone does, so the call still never actually executes on a runner; it `pytest.skip`s
    there instead, and only runs (restoring the drift-class detection this function's own move
    once removed) on a developer's own full-history checkout."""
