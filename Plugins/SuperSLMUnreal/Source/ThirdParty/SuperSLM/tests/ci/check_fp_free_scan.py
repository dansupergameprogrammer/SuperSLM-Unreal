"""check_fp_free_scan.py -- design Sec4.1's deciding instrument (T-2338, Brunel),
built to the RATIFIED production contract (fold round 33,
`Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-superslm-fp-free-open-design-2026-08-24.md` Sec4.1 / Sec7
dimension 11; D-SLM4826/D-SLM4827/D-SLM4830/D-SLM4834; test contract
`tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/test_check_fp_free_scan.py`).

WHAT THIS IS. An instruction-level, byte-accounting, default-deny scan over
compiled machine code. It decodes an object's own bytes (never a disassembler's
rendered text), classifies every instruction and every call/tail-jmp edge, and
emits a per-symbol ACCEPT/REJECT verdict -- or REFUSES the whole object,
emitting no verdict for any symbol in it, whenever any byte of any code section
cannot be fully accounted for.

THE FIRST LAW (design Sec4.1, fold round 9/11, restated as the instrument's own
governing rule): every stage accounts for what it discarded, and a stage that
cannot classify its input emits a rejection rather than a silence. Concretely:
this reader counts, per code section, the bytes it could not attribute to a
decoded instruction, a symbol-grounded data range, or a recognised padding
run, and REFUSES -- emits no verdict for any symbol in the OBJECT -- whenever
that count is nonzero anywhere in the object. A REFUSE is not a defect in the
scan; it is the scan doing its job.

THE COVERAGE RELATION (fold rounds 13/14). Every byte of a code section is
covered by exactly one of three things, or it is unaccounted:
  1. a CODE EXTENT -- the byte range a (possibly aliased) code symbol's own
     instructions occupy, chain-decoded exactly from the symbol's own start to
     its own end (declared size when the object states one, else the next
     WITNESSED boundary -- any function-typed symbol regardless of storage
     class, or any external/object-typed non-function symbol; COFF
     STATIC/LABEL bookkeeping symbols and any ELF symbol that is neither
     function- nor object-typed witness nothing). A gap, an overlap, or a
     SPILL (an instruction whose own span would read past the extent's own
     end -- the classic movabs-swallow shape) stops the chain at the point of
     failure; an empty extent, or any partial chain, makes that symbol's own
     attribution unverifiable and REFUSES THE WHOLE OBJECT, not only that
     symbol -- a symbol table shown to place one code symbol inconsistently is
     not trusted to have bounded its neighbours correctly either.
  2. a DATA EXTENT -- grounded in the object's own relocation/unwind metadata.
     THIS READER IMPLEMENTS NO SUCH GROUNDING (named residual, this ticket's
     own build record) -- an object-typed/external non-function witnessing
     symbol still marks a BOUNDARY (so it correctly clamps a neighbouring
     code extent) but is never credited as covering its own bytes; those
     bytes fall through to test 3 and REFUSE when they are not pure padding,
     the conservative, fail-closed disposition the design's own text names as
     correct rather than a defect.
  3. a RECOGNISED PADDING RUN -- every byte in an otherwise-uncovered span
     (an inter-extent gap, or a partial extent's own unclaimed tail) matches
     one of the ISA's own no-op byte patterns (x86: 0x90/0xCC repeated;
     AArch64: the fixed 4-byte NOP encoding repeated). Decodability plays no
     role in this test.

CHECKS (A)/(B)/(C), run only once a section's accounting is clean: (A) a
register-file classification, default-deny over any instruction touching a
vector/FP/mask/tile register unless the mnemonic is on a closed movement-only
allowlist (or is packed-integer/self-zeroing-xor by a structural naming rule);
(B) a pinned GPR/control-flow mnemonic allowlist, default-deny over everything
that does not touch a vector/FP register at all; (C) a default-deny call/
tail-jmp target allowlist -- an edge to a symbol inside this object's own
scanned table needs no separate vetting (the target is scanned in its own
right); an edge to a symbol outside it is accepted only if individually
vetted (EXTERN_ALLOW); an edge this reader cannot statically resolve (an
indirect call/jmp, or a direct edge with no relocation and no matching local
symbol) is rejected.

NAMED RESIDUALS (this build; see the build record's own Sec10-style list for
the full disposition and what would close each): no Mach-O reader (Sec4.1
itself discloses this design has never had one); the AArch64 GPR/control-flow
allowlist below is derived from this ticket's own probe objects, not a
re-derivation against the real 17-TU corpus rebuilt for AArch64 (unchanged
disposition from design Sec7 dim 11's own tenth/eleventh populations); check
(C)'s relocation-to-symbol resolution is COFF- and ELF-RELA-complete for the
object shapes this repo's own toolchains produce, but does not implement every
relocation TYPE a linker recognises -- an edge whose relocation type this
reader does not recognise is treated as unresolved (rejected), never silently
accepted.

    """Design Sec4.1, D-SLM5035, as amended by D-SLM5054 (even-byte member
    padding). Opens `path` and reads its first 8 bytes: they MUST equal the
    literal magic `b"!<arch>\\n"`, the common `ar` container both GNU/Unix
    `ar` and Microsoft's `lib.exe` share. A file shorter than 8 bytes, a
    mismatched magic, or a file that cannot be opened at all raises
    `ValueError` -- an INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE (exit 2, never a pass),
    identical in kind to today's "build directory not found," but the
    design's own text names no specific exception class for a magic
    mismatch (unlike `MalformedArchiveError`, reserved for header-level
    corruption below), so any caller here catches `Exception` broadly for
    this branch.

    After the magic, members are read sequentially, each preceded by a
    fixed 60-byte header: name[16], mtime[12], uid[6], gid[6], mode[8],
    size[10], end[2]. Three checks, each individually load-bearing: `end`
    MUST equal the literal two bytes 0x60 0x0A; `size` MUST parse as a
    base-10 ASCII integer (space-padded, no other character permitted); the
    member's declared size MUST NOT exceed the bytes actually remaining in
    the file. Any header failing any one of these three RAISES
    `MalformedArchiveError` naming the byte offset of the failing header.

    Each member's own 16-byte `name` field resolves to exactly one of three
    kinds, with no fourth branch: SYMTAB ("/" or "/SYM64/"), LONGNAMES
    ("//"), or OBJECT (a literal ".obj"/".o" in the name field directly, or
    a GNU-style "/<offset>" reference into the already-read longnames
    member). A member matching none of the three RAISES
    `MalformedArchiveError` -- there is no "assume object" default.

    D-SLM5054: `ar`'s own even-byte member padding. When a member's own
    `size` is odd, exactly one pad byte follows the payload before the next
    60-byte header begins -- this reader advances past it when computing
    the next header's offset; the pad byte is never yielded as part of any
    `ArchiveMember`'s payload and is not itself subject to the three
    header-level checks above.

# D-SLM5155/D-SLM5156 (Dan, 2026-08-29): the fail-closed question the deny
# list above left open is ruled closed. This is the fail-closed replacement
# design Sec4.1 specifies: an explicit, checked-in allow-list, built by
# enumerating capstone's real x86-64 p/vp-prefixed vocabulary (the same
# 1523-mnemonic census this module's own test suite pins) and excluding the
# six mnemonics `_X86_P_PREFIX_EXCLUDE` names above.
#
# D-SLM5229 (Dan, 2026-08-29, correcting a T-2406 review finding, S1): the
# construction below is classify-and-DENY, not classify-and-vet -- every
# member is admitted because it is the naming-convention set less the
# six-entry deny list, NOT because it was separately, individually checked
# against ISA-reference IEEE-754 semantics. The published claim that each
# entry was so vetted was false; only the six deny-list entries received
# that individual check. What makes this fail closed is the FREEZE, not a
# vetting the construction never performed: the set is computed once
# against a named, re-executable reference vocabulary, requiring an
# explicit, reviewed diff for any future addition -- built the same way
# GPR_ALLOW's own fold-8 freeze was (D-SLM4374) -- so an unknown future
# p/vp mnemonic REJECTs by default instead of being admitted by the old
# rule's own silence.
#
# This is the real vocabulary's p/vp-prefixed, non-`pf`-prefixed membership
# (excluding `_X86_VEC_MOVE_ALLOW`'s own named entries, which ACCEPT via
# that list and never reach this one) with the six documented FP leaks
# `_X86_P_PREFIX_EXCLUDE` names above removed. `_X86_P_PREFIX_EXCLUDE`'s
# six entries are retained above as documentation of what was individually
# considered and excluded; they are no longer load-bearing as a gate --
# this allow-list is now the sole authority for the p/vp branch below.

    D-SLM4856; Sec5.5's own three-way ship-gate disjunction): an aggregate
    over the WHOLE corpus. Returns True iff, for every object path in
    `expected_symbols`: `ci_gate(results[path], expected_symbols[path])` is
    True, AND every value in `results[path].verdicts` is "ACCEPT". A single
    REJECT anywhere, on any object, makes the whole call return False --
    additive to `ci_gate`'s own three guarantees, never a replacement:
    `ci_gate` still decides whether a leg is well-formed (refuses cleanly,
    or reports every expected symbol); this function's own fourth condition
    decides whether what every leg reported is ACCEPTABLE.

    Before this function existed, nothing in this design or in the tree
    converted a REJECT verdict into a failed job (Popper's D-SLM4851,
    commissioned DEAD: `ci_gate` returned True on a must-reject construction
    at every magnitude tested, because neither it nor anything upstream of
    it ever read a verdict's VALUE).

    Corrected at fold round 35 (D-SLM4888, closing Popper's own t2345
    Sec5.7 KILL): the contract above is vacuously satisfiable. "For every
    object path in `expected_symbols`" is true of every object in an empty
    map, so `ci_gate_corpus({}, {})` returned True, as did a map that
    listed every object except the one carrying a REJECT (reachable
    end-to-end from the shipped driver through an ordinary edit to a real
    CMakeLists.txt -- `derive_core_sources`'s own zero-source failure mode,
    corrected above, used to produce exactly this map). `expected_symbols`
    is not entitled to be read as authoritative on its own: it must be
    non-empty, and it must name EXACTLY the same object paths `results`
    does -- a caller can no longer avoid a REJECT by supplying a map
    smaller than the corpus it actually scanned, nor pass two empty maps
    and read the vacuous True as a clean corpus.

    When `manifest_path` and/or `build_dir` is supplied (the production
    driver's own real corpus run always supplies its own `build_dir`),
    this additionally re-derives the corpus's OWN current membership via
    `enumerate_scan_targets()` against that same manifest/build_dir and
    requires `expected_symbols.keys()` to be exactly that independently
    re-derived set too -- closing the gap that comparing `results` against
    `expected_symbols` alone cannot: both could agree by omission if an
    object silently never made it into either map. `None` (the default)
    skips this second, stronger check for an isolated must-accept/
    must-reject construction with no real manifest or build directory to
    re-derive against, mirroring `scan_object`'s own `corpus_symbols=None`
