"""Curie's population-validation suite for S-HARDEN-7's `membership-check` CI
job (Claude/Vitruvius/SuperSLM_SHARDEN678_Bundle_Design-2026-07-23.md Sec3.2,
Sec3.3; T-411).

Per the commission: the adversary's four strike probes (Claude/Loki/
superslm-sharden678-bundle-strike-2026-07-23-probe-*) ARE the
independently-found validation population StandardsDocument Sec4 requires --
they derived the PRIOR rule's population three ways and proved it collapsed
to 12/13/14 depending on scan strategy, which is what forced the rule's
correction (condition 2, condition 4(b)) in the first place. This suite
reuses that same three-way scan-strategy methodology, extended (in
tests/ci/derive_bad_alloc_membership.py) to the CORRECTED, four-condition
rule, and confirms the corrected rule's own defining claim: the population is
no longer a function of which translation unit happens to be scanned.

Requires a clang++ on PATH capable of `-Xclang -ast-dump=json` (Clang 18.1.8
locally; GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` hosted runner ships one per its published
software manifest, independent of S-HARDEN-6, design Sec3.1's "Independence
from S-HARDEN-6" note). Every test below is skipped, not failed, when no
such clang++ is available -- an environment gap is not a population defect.

    companion literal, `COMMIT_COUNT_PIN: N`, that is also committed in the same file's header.
    Per StandardsDocument.md Sec5.6's preference for removing a term from a formula over adding a
    rule to remember it, the count is no longer independently re-derived from live history on
    every CI run; deriving it from `git log --follow` now happens only when a human runs
    `python tests/ci/derive_bad_alloc_membership.py --commit-count` on their own full-history
    checkout, at regeneration time, and pastes the result into both the prose word and the pin
    together -- the same shape `tests/ci/check_present_tense_defect_comments.py` (T-2387) already
    uses for the identical class: a live git call in a CI-collected cell silently degraded on a
    depth-1 checkout, closed there by vendoring the value instead of re-deriving it live. This
    cell's own job is narrower than the one it replaces -- it catches a human mistranscribing the
    word relative to the pin, not history drifting past both of them unnoticed -- which is the
    whole of what a depth-1 checkout can verify.

    T-2499 (Claude/Poirot/bc2ae29-t2498-census-fixes-confirmation.md Significant 1, D-SLM5775):
    this narrowing was real -- the class the replaced cell caught (the pin drifting from the
    file's own true history; four recorded instances: T-2467, T-2481, T-2491, T-2497) went from
    "caught on every developer checkout, broken in CI" to "caught nowhere." Restored, on the
    checkouts where it can run, by the companion cell immediately below."""

    provide by construction -- that cell only catches a human mistranscribing the prose word

    history, which is the class that has recurred four times (T-2467, T-2481, T-2491, T-2497),
    each caught only by a reviewer reading the paragraph. Executed on that exact shape (one
    comment-only commit to this file, neither number updated): a fresh `git log --follow` gives
    16 where the prose word and the pin both still read 15 -- this cell fails, the replaced cell
    (T-2497) would have failed too, and `test_oracle_header_commit_count_pin_matches_the_prose_
    word` passes throughout, because both its own numbers agree with each other while both are
    stale together.

    Guarded the same way `tools/ci/check_abi_header_inventory.py` degrades when its own
    population source is unavailable: `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` decides, and a
    shallow checkout SKIPS explicitly (printed by the `-v` the gating job already runs), rather
    than reporting a false pass (a shallow clone's own `git log --follow` returns 1 unconditionally,
    which would make this cell either always-red on every CI run or -- if compared to itself --
    vacuously green) or a false fail. `actions/checkout@v5` defaults to a depth-1 clone and no job
    in `.github/workflows/` sets `fetch-depth`, so this cell is not expected to run in CI; it runs
    on every developer's own full-history checkout, which is exactly where `pytest tests/ci/` was
    run before each of the four drift instances landed -- the environment the replaced cell was
    actually useful in: "The replaced cell was red in CI and green nowhere it mattered; it was,
    however, red on every developer machine, which is where `pytest tests/ci/` is run before a
