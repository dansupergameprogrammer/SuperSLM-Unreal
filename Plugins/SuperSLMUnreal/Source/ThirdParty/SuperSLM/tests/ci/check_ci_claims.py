"""CI source check: no public document restates a present-tense CI-execution
claim outside `docs/platform-support.md`'s own "CI execution status" section --
the one place this project's public prose is allowed to state what its hosted
CI has actually run (T-2195 remedy S3; `Claude/Poirot/
1381076-t2195-t2189-closing-confirmation.md`).

WHY THIS SHAPE. The same overclaim recurred across four consecutive review
rounds (T-2191, T-2192, T-2195, T-2196), each time in different words the
prior round's own fix did not anticipate: "exercised at continuous-integration
extent", "CI-probed on hosted runners", "proven bit-identical and exercised in
continuous integration", "runs on every push, and is fully green". A literal
phrase list closes exactly the phrasings already found and nothing else. This
module is scoped by MEANING instead: any clause naming CI (the token `CI`,
`continuous integration` (also hyphenated), `GitHub Actions`, `hosted
runner(s)`, `the matrix`/`the workflow(s)`, or the compound `CI-<verb>` shape)
alongside an unhedged present-tense execution or passing verb (`is
exercised/validated/tested`, `runs on every`, `is green/passing`, `executes`,
`CI-exercised/probed/tested/validated`) is flagged, unless the same clause
carries a negation cue (`not`/`never`/`capped`/`no further`/etc). A NEW
paraphrase of the same claim is caught by the rule without a new literal
entry -- what the phrase-list approach this module replaces could not do.

T-2196'S OWN FINDING (S1): THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS MODULE DID NOT CATCH THE
SENTENCE IT WAS BUILT FOR. Two independent causes, both fixed here and both
pinned by their own regression cells:

1. THE CLAUSE SPLITTER SHREDDED THE SENTENCE. The first version split on
   every `.` and `;` unconditionally (`re.split(r'[.;]| -- | — ', text)`).
   Applied to "The workflows exist and define the full matrix
   ([.github/workflows/tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml)), runs on
   every push, and is **fully green on the 1.0 release commit**", the
   periods inside the filename `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and the link
   target cut the one sentence into six fragments -- the noun landed in one
   fragment, the verb in another, and neither fragment carried both. Fixed
   here by masking every period that lives inside a markdown link target, an
   inline code span, a bracketed link label, or a version number (`1.0`,
   `1.1.0`) BEFORE searching for clause-boundary periods (`_mask_non_
   sentence_periods`), so a split point is only ever found at a period that
   is genuinely a sentence boundary in the ORIGINAL, un-masked text.
2. AN EXEMPTION MATCHED EXACTLY ONE CLAUSE IN THE WHOLE SCANNED CORPUS. The
   negation word list included `no further`, present in this project's
   public prose in exactly one place (`README.md`'s own "CI extent" defining
   sentence: "...and no further hardware-specific measurement has been made
   beyond what that gives"). Under the FIRST version's broken splitter, that
   phrase's clause boundary was also wrong, and the exemption's only
   measured effect on this tree was to silently clear the one real
   violation the check would otherwise have caught in the neighboring,
   un-hedged sentence. Per `StandardsDocument.md` Sec4, an exemption pattern
   that matches exactly one clause in the corpus IS the finding: audited
   here and kept, because with the splitter fixed it correctly scopes to
   its OWN sentence only ("CI extent" means... and no further measurement
   has been made -- a genuine, single-sentence hedge) and no longer bleeds
   into the neighboring sentence the splitter used to merge it with. Every
   other negation word (`not`, `never`, `hasn't`, `has not`, `have not`,
   `capped`) was checked against the same historical corpus below and each
   has more than one legitimate hit; none is a lone-match exemption.

RULE COVERAGE, MEASURED. `tests/ci/ci_claims_historical_fixtures/` holds the
exact recovered text of every site four review rounds found this class at:
`CHANGELOG.md`'s and `docs/platform-support.md`'s Known-gaps AVX-512 bullets,
`README.md`'s AVX-512 roadmap bullet, the SSE2/AVX2/AVX-512 kernel-tier table
rows in `docs/platform-support.md`, and `README.md`'s own CI-extent paragraph
(the sentence T-2196 S1 found this module's first version could not catch).
`test_check_ci_claims.py`'s `test_fires_on_every_historical_pre_fix_site` and
`test_does_not_fire_on_any_historical_post_fix_site` replay both states
through this module's own scanner and assert 7/7 fire before the fix and 0/7
false-fire on the current, corrected text -- fixing nothing here, per
`StandardsDocument.md` Sec4's population-validation requirement.

INPUT COVERAGE AND ENVIRONMENT (T-2196 S2). The prior version of this check
lived as an inline `python3 -c "..."` block inside a single hosted-runner-only
GitHub Actions job (`workflow-lint`, `ubuntu-latest`), was not reachable by
`pytest tests/ci/`, and had no self-test -- unlike every sibling structural
checker in this directory (`check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`, `check_present_
tense_defect_comments.py`, `check_gpu_guard_status_parity.py`), each a
`tests/ci/check_*.py` module with a `tests/ci/test_check_*.py` self-test,
invoked from CI by the same two-step shape (self-test, then the gate script)
and runnable locally by any pytest invocation. This module now matches that
convention: it runs anywhere `pytest tests/ci/` runs (the machine this
project actually develops and tests on, per `docs/platform-support.md`'s own
CI execution status section -- GitHub Actions hosted runs have not executed
since 2026-07-23), not only on a capped hosted runner. Path comparisons use
`os.path.normpath` rather than a literal `'docs/platform-support.md'` string
(T-2196 S2's third face: `glob.glob('docs/*.md')` yields backslash-separated
paths on Windows, so a literal forward-slash comparison never matched and the
prior version reported a false violation against a clean tree on the one
platform this project runs anything on).

CHANGELOG.MD SCOPING. Widening the verb pattern to catch the historical
corpus's bare-past-participle shape ("...is proven bit-identical and
exercised in continuous integration") also caught a real hit outside the
seven fixture sites: `CHANGELOG.md`'s own 1.0 release entry, "Linux and
macOS are exercised at continuous-integration extent only" -- exactly the
one surviving hit T-2196's own tree-wide grep found and accepted as "true
when written and remains true," not a live overclaim. `CHANGELOG.md` is
dated release history (Keep a Changelog convention, newest section first);
a claim inside an already-shipped, older `## [x.y.z]` section is a dated
record of what was true at that release, not a claim about today's CI. Only
the LATEST release section (or the un-headed preamble, if any) is scanned
for `CHANGELOG.md` (`_scope_changelog_to_latest_release`) -- the release
actually being published stays in scope, and shipped history is not
re-litigated on every run.

Modelled on `tests/ci/check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`'s and `check_present_
tense_defect_comments.py`'s own conventions: a text scan (not a markdown
parse) over a fixed target-file list, a `scan_files`/`scan_text` pair
returning formatted failure strings, and a `main()` that fails loud.
