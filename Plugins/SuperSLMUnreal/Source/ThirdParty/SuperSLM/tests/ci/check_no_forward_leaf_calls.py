"""CI source check: no translation unit in the forward composition may name a
checked-chain-funnel leaf directly, outside the funnel's own file and the leaf
certification TUs (SuperSLM_S3a_WalkingSkeleton_Plan.md Sec7.3; T-200,
Sec17.3 cell 5; S3.1).

This is the structural half of the funnel (Sec7.3): a lint rule and a wrapper
type were both considered and rejected there in favour of a single-entry-point
funnel PLUS this check, which is what stops a future call site from reaching a
caller-ensures leaf directly instead of routing through the checked entry
points (`RequantChainChecked` / `NarrowRowChecked`).

Modelled on the precedent already in the tree, tests/check_no_pow_operator.py,
with the one property that precedent does NOT need and this check does: an
INPUT SET derived from a directory glob rather than a hardcoded file tuple
(Sec7.3 names check_no_pow_operator.py's hardcoded two-element tuple as "the
precedent's own weakness, not inherited"). One property does NOT fully
transfer: check_no_pow_operator.py gets its precision from `ast.parse` over
Python; a ban on C++ identifiers in forward TUs has no AST behind it here and
is a text scan (Sec7.3, verbatim) -- but not a raw one.

CORRECTED (T-2125): the scan is comment-aware. `find_banned_leaf_uses` blanks
`//` line comments and `/* */` block comments before running the leaf-name
regex (`_strip_comments_preserving_line_numbers`, below -- newlines are kept
exactly where they were, so a hit reported after a multi-line block comment
still carries its real line number), rather than scanning the raw byte
stream. Prose that NAMES a leaf while documenting why a nearby function calls
it -- e.g. a comment explaining that `BiasReconcileWide` "uses the same
portable 128-bit facility RequantTokenCode/IExpEvaluate already use
internally" (`src/forward/forward_sites.cpp`) -- is not a call site and must
not fail this check; a raw substring scan cannot tell the two apart, which is
exactly the gap this correction closes (found live: that exact comment
reddened the real-tree end-to-end cell with zero code change, a checker
defect, not a code regression). A leaf name inside a STRING or char literal
is still an accepted over-approximation -- this module tracks literal state
only to keep a `//`/`/*` inside one from being misread as a comment opener
(CORRECTED further, T-2125 fix round, Poirot 242dc12-t2125-ci-drift-
review.md Significant 1: the first version of the comment stripper had no
notion of "inside a literal" at all, which traded that false positive for a
false NEGATIVE -- a `//` inside an ordinary string blanked the rest of its
line, and a bare `"/*"` string opened a block comment that swallowed every
real call up to the next genuine `*/`; both executed and reproduced live at
review time, see `_strip_comments_preserving_line_numbers`'s own docstring
below for the fix), it does not classify what the literal's own content
means, and the rule remains a ban rather than a full classifier for that one
remaining shape.

WHERE THIS STANDS AS OF THE S3.1 HEADER-CONTRACT BUILD (2026-07-28, commit
32aca0c, T-200): `src/forward/checked_chain_funnel.cpp` now exists and
_DEFAULT_FORWARD_GLOBS resolves to exactly that one real file against the
tree. main()'s end-to-end run against it is no longer vacuous --
test_check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py's own
`test_main_end_to_end_against_the_real_default_glob_is_no_longer_vacuous`
asserts the real, exact population and that the real tree passes -- though
that cell proves the WIRING (the real glob and allowlist agree on the real
file), not the MECHANISM (a real banned-leaf call being caught): the funnel's
own file is allowlisted, and `scan_files` skips reading an allowlisted path's
content at all, so every mechanism cell still drives this module against
constructed fixture files standing in for "a forward TU," per
StandardsDocument Sec4's population-validation requirement.

UPDATED AT THE S3.2 HEADER-CONTRACT BUILD (2026-07-28, commit a594dd2): the
build staged S3.2's site compositions at `src/forward_sites.cpp` rather than
under `src/forward/`, specifically so this module's own exact-population
assertion (then hardcoded to one file) would not need editing as part of that
pass -- see that build log (Claude/Brunel/superslm-s3.2-weightless-and-
projection-sites-contract-build-2026-07-28.md) and the file's own placement
comment. That left `src/forward_sites.cpp` -- a real forward-composition
source, in the plan's own sense -- entirely outside _DEFAULT_FORWARD_GLOBS'
scan root, so a banned leaf called directly from it would pass this check
with nothing to catch it: the structural guarantee Sec7.3 exists to hold had
a hole exactly where the newest site compositions live.

Closed here by widening _DEFAULT_FORWARD_GLOBS to also name
`src/forward_sites.cpp` explicitly (it is NOT added to _DEFAULT_ALLOWLIST --
it is scanned, not exempted) and by moving the "expected real population"
this module's own end-to-end test asserts from a hardcoded count of one to a
named, sized set (_EXPECTED_REAL_FORWARD_FILES, below) that already lists
both real files. Physically relocating `src/forward_sites.cpp` under
`src/forward/` (the placement the S3.2 build log itself named as the
eventual, cleaner fix) is a production-source change outside this module's
own writable surface (`tests/`) and is routed rather than done here; this
widening closes the coverage gap immediately, independent of whether or when
that move happens, and keeps working unchanged after it does (the sibling
glob entry becomes redundant with the directory glob at that point, not
wrong).

# still found three more missed shapes, one of them newly introduced by the

# already a live style at src/bad_alloc_wrap.h:49) silently passed because
# `_SIGNATURE_TAIL_RE` admitted only optional `noexcept` between `)` and `{`;
# a door inside an `extern "C" { ... }` linkage block silently passed because
# the brace-context tracker only ever tagged a brace "namespace" or "other",
# never "extern C"; and a C++14 digit separator (`1'000`) appearing an ODD
# number of times in the file blanked EVERYTHING from it to end of file,
# because the comment/string stripper treated every `'` as a char-literal
# opener with no way to tell a digit separator from a real char literal by
# text alone -- silently erasing every door after it.
#
# Per `StandardsDocument.md` Sec4, a defect class that survives a second,
# carefully-executed repair is repaired by removing the class, not by
# patching a third special case onto the same recognizer: comments, string
# and char literals, digit separators, namespace/extern-"C" nesting at any
# depth, and trailing return types are not six special cases to enumerate by
# hand, they are ordinary nodes a real C++ grammar already resolves. This
# section replaces the hand-rolled text scanner (the comment/string stripper
# and the brace-tracking function-body finder, both removed) with a Clang AST
# walk over the funnel's own one file, mirroring the pattern already
# CI-wired in this repo at `tests/ci/derive_bad_alloc_membership.py`/
# `tools/ci/check_bad_alloc_contract.py` (same pinned `clang++-18`, same
# `ubuntu-latest` runner image; `.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s
# `bad-alloc-membership-check` job proves the exact binary is present
# there). The whole-tree leaf ban (`scan_files`/`find_banned_leaf_uses`,
# below) is UNCHANGED -- it is a deliberately over-approximate text scan by
# design (a ban, not a classifier; Sec7.3's own module docstring) and
# carries no soundness gap this replaces.
#
# `-fsyntax-only -Xclang -ast-dump=json` still emits a full AST for a scratch
# file with no `#include`s at all (every banned-leaf name and every type
# unresolved): Clang's error-recovery machinery represents an unresolved call
# as an `UnresolvedLookupExpr` carrying the callee's name directly, and an
# unresolved type does not prevent the enclosing `FunctionDecl`, its name, or
# its `CompoundStmt` body from appearing in the dump. This is what lets the
# same population of constructed, include-free scratch fixtures this suite
# already uses drive the AST-based mechanism exactly as they drove the text
# scanner, with no synthetic header prelude required (confirmed by execution:
# `clang++ -Xclang -ast-dump=json -fsyntax-only` on a bare
# `int64_t CarriedScaleReciprocal(int64_t m) { return
# DynamicScaleReciprocal(m); }` -- no includes, no declarations -- exits 0
# and dumps a `FunctionDecl` named `CarriedScaleReciprocal` whose body
# contains an `UnresolvedLookupExpr` named `DynamicScaleReciprocal`).
#
# Validated against the same population `test_check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`
# already carries (five constructed doors plus the false-positive control)
# PLUS the three shapes this review found still missed (trailing return type,
# `extern "C" { }`, the odd-count digit separator) -- nine cases in total,
# each executed against BOTH the text-scan mechanism being replaced
# (reproduced verbatim in the test file, since this module no longer carries
# it) and this AST-based one, so the improvement is measured rather than
# asserted (StandardsDocument Sec4).

# CORRECTED 2026-07-31 (Poirot 5eff945-t1380-t1381-t1382-review-2026-07-31.md,
# Significant 1; T-1383): the paragraph just above this one shipped true; the
# ORIGINAL `_TOP_LEVEL_FUNCTION_KINDS` docstring (the comment directly below,
# now corrected in place) shipped a parity claim that was false the moment it
# was written -- admitting `FunctionDecl` only was argued to exclude a member
# function "exactly as the prior text scanner's brace-context tag 'other'
# did," which holds for an IN-CLASS member definition but not for an
# OUT-OF-LINE one (`Ret S::Door(...) { ... }`), which is not nested inside a
# struct body at all and which BOTH retired scanners caught. `find_leaf_
# forwarding_doors` now admits member-function kinds alongside `FunctionDecl`
# (both in-class and out-of-line member definitions surface as the identical
# `CXXMethodDecl` kind, confirmed by execution -- indistinguishable by kind
# alone), guarded so a lambda's own closure-type call operator -- itself a
# `CXXMethodDecl`, lexically nested inside a `LambdaExpr` -- is never counted
# as a separate top-level door: that guard is what keeps this widening from
# regressing `test_t1381_ast_mechanism_finds_a_door_hidden_inside_a_lambda_
# in_real_declared_code` into reporting two doors for one. Population widened
# by: the nine T-1381 required (unchanged and re-verified against the fixed
# mechanism); the two further shapes T-1381's own independent sweep already
# found (a leaf call hidden inside a lambda defined in a door's own body,
# against real declared code; and a local variable shadowing a leaf's name),
# both unchanged and re-verified here too; the out-of-line member door this
# correction targets; and two further shapes an independent sweep found this
# round -- an in-class member door, now also caught as a consequence of the
# same fix, and a namespace-scope function pointer initialised to a leaf's
# address, which remains missed by this mechanism and by both retired
# scanners alike: a `VarDecl` carries no `FunctionDecl`/`CXXMethodDecl` node
# for either generation to find, so this is documented parity, not a
# regression, and is not fixed here. See `test_check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`'s
# own T-1383 section for all three new cases this correction adds, each
# executed against a verbatim reproduction of the mechanism this correction
# replaces, exactly as the nine cases above are measured against the

    spaces -- every newline byte kept exactly where it was, so line numbers
    computed against the RETURNED text still match the original file
    line-for-line. Mirrors the `strip_comments` convention already used by
    tests/ci/check_gpu_guard_status_parity.py and tests/ci/
    check_gemm_site_thread_width_parity.py, adapted to BLANK rather than
    DELETE so the (line, leaf) hits this module reports stay accurate against
    the original file.

    CORRECTED (T-2125 fix round, Poirot 242dc12-t2125-ci-drift-review.md,
    Significant 1): the first version of this function scanned for `//` and
    `/*` with no notion of "inside a string or char literal," which traded
    the false positive it was written to close for a false NEGATIVE -- the
    harmful direction for a ban. A `//` inside an ordinary string (e.g.
    `"scheme://host"`) blanked the rest of its line, silently hiding a real
    call later on that same line; a bare `"/*"` string opened a block comment
    that ran to the next real `*/`, however far away, swallowing every real
    call in between. Both executed and reproduced live at review time.

    String literals (`"..."`), char literals (`'...'`), and raw string
    literals (`R"delim(...)delim"`, with the u8/u/U/L encoding-prefix
    variants) are now tracked as a literal state, entered and exited by this
    same single pass, and their bytes are copied through verbatim rather than
    scanned for `//`/`/*` -- a comment marker inside one is literal content,
    never a comment opener. Backslash escapes inside a string or char literal
    (`\\"`, `\\'`, `\\\\`) are honored so an escaped quote does not end the
    literal early. Leaf names inside a (non-raw-string-delimiter) literal
    are therefore still reported by `find_banned_leaf_uses`, because the
    literal's own text is preserved, not blanked -- the module docstring's
    named, deliberate over-approximation for that one remaining shape is
    unchanged by this correction.

    A C++14 digit separator (`1'000`) is distinguished from a char-literal
    opener the same way this repo's own T-1381/T-1383 sweep already had to
    for the sibling AST-based door scanner this module replaced (see this
    module's history above): a `'` immediately preceded by an alphanumeric
    character is treated as a separator, not an opener, because no valid
    char literal can be immediately preceded by an identifier or digit
    character with no operator between them -- the exact defect class that
    sweep found silently erasing everything after an odd-count digit
    separator in a hand-rolled stripper, closed here before it could recur
    in this one."""
