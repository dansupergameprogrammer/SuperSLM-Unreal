"""CI source scan: a tripwire for stdout-writing spellings in the shipped `superslm`/`superslm_gpu`
library sources (TE-400, D-SLM7753; TE-402 S3; promise narrowed by D-SLM7783).

WHAT IT PROMISES. The scan refuses any `src/`/`include/` source file that names one of the banned
stdout-writing identifiers below, or the token-paste operator, outside a comment or a string/char
literal. It is a tripwire for those spellings, not a proof that the library writes nothing to
stdout: code that reaches stdout without naming a listed identifier can pass. That the 1.7.1
library writes nothing to stdout is a separate claim, verified for that release by a hand sweep
of the tree, not by this scan.

WHAT IS BANNED -- defined in exactly one place, `_BANNED_IDENTIFIERS`, `_BANNED_IDENTIFIER_FAMILY`
and `_BANNED_OPERATORS` below. Identifiers and the family are matched as whole words,
case-sensitively; the operators are matched wherever they occur.

- `_BANNED_IDENTIFIERS`, 28 names:
  - stream and handle names: `stdout`, `STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`, `cout`, `wcout`, `__acrt_iob_func`
    (the UCRT's own expansion of `stdout`), `GetStdHandle`;
  - the printf family: `printf`, `wprintf`, `vprintf`, `vwprintf`, `printf_s`, `wprintf_s`,
    `vprintf_s`, `vwprintf_s`;
  - character and string writers: `puts`, `_putws`, `putchar`, `putwchar`, `_fputchar`,
    `_fputwchar`;
  - raw writes: `write`, `_write`, `WriteFile`, `WriteConsole`, `WriteConsoleA`, `WriteConsoleW`;
  - descriptor-to-stream openers: `fdopen`, `_fdopen`.
- `_BANNED_IDENTIFIER_FAMILY`, the MSVC underscore-prefixed printf family, regex
  `_\\w*printf(?:_s)?_[lp]\\w*`: an identifier that starts with `_`, contains `printf`, then
  optionally `_s`, then `_l` or `_p`, then any identifier characters. It covers `_printf_l`,
  `_printf_p`, `_printf_p_l`, `_printf_s_l` (the `_s_l` extension), `_vwprintf_p`, `_wprintf_s_l`,
  and the stream and buffer variants in the same family, such as `_fprintf_p` and `_sprintf_l`.
- `_BANNED_OPERATORS`: the token-paste operator `##` and its digraph spelling `%:%:`, because
  pasting can assemble any banned name from fragments no word-level ban can see.

`stderr`, `fprintf` and `fwprintf` are not banned: `fprintf(stderr, ...)` is this library's
diagnostic channel. A line that names them together with `stdout` is refused by the `stdout` ban.
Some banned identifiers also write to targets other than stdout (`write`, `WriteFile`), and the
family pattern catches some that never write to stdout (`_sprintf_l`). They are banned outright
because the library uses none of them, and a future legitimate use is a reviewed change to this
list rather than a silent pass.

HOW. A text scan, not a C++ parser. `_strip_comments_and_literals` blanks comments and
string/char literals with equal-length whitespace, keeping every newline, so reported line numbers
are exact. It recognises C++14 digit separators (a `'` inside a number such as `1'000` is not a
character-literal delimiter) and raw string literals (`R"delim(...)delim"`, with the prefixes
`u8R`, `uR`, `UR` and `LR`). A `//` comment continues onto the next line when its line ends in a
backslash immediately before the line ending (LF or CRLF), as many times as that repeats, as C++
line splicing does. An ordinary string or character literal ends at an unescaped newline,
which a well-formed literal cannot contain, so a quote the stripper misreads cannot blank the lines
after it. The ban then runs on what survives. Scanned extensions: `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.inc`,
`.def`, `.inl`, `.ipp`, `.hlsl`, `.hlsli` (`include/superslm/sslm_abi_functions.inc` is part of the
public API, included by `include/superslm/sslm_abi.h`).

Known limits, each a way code can pass the scan: preprocessor tricks other than token pasting
(a macro whose expansion names a banned identifier defined outside `src/`/`include/`), function
pointers or handles obtained without naming a listed identifier, writes to a descriptor or
handle that equals stdout's without being named as such, and a banned identifier split across
lines by a backslash-newline splice in code (the ban reads one line at a time).

The interface is pinned by tests/ci/test_te399_stdout_write_scan_commission.py:
`scan_for_stdout_writes(root_dirs)` and `main(argv)`. Exit code 0 iff no scanned file contains a
banned token outside a comment or literal; 1 otherwise, naming every `path:line: reason` hit.
