"""run_fp_free_scan_real_corpus.py (T-2338/T-2343, Brunel) -- population
eight's real occupant: a whole-corpus build-and-scan of the real,
currently-committed `SUPERSLM_CORE_SOURCES` (CMakeLists.txt), through the
production instrument (`check_fp_free_scan.py`) at `isa="x86-64"` -- the
toolchain (MSVC cl.exe, COFF) the design's own whole-corpus clean-scan claim
(Sec4.1, fold rounds 8/13/14) was measured on.

`test_check_fp_free_scan.py::test_population_08_real_corpus_whole_sweep` is,
by its own docstring, "Not gradable by this single pytest cell even once the
instrument exists -- a full-corpus build-and-scan is CI-scale, not a unit
cell." That test verifies the 17-file population is real and calls
`pytest.fail` unconditionally; it is not this population's own discharge.
THIS script is: it compiles all 17 real translation units fresh (never a
committed binary), scans each compiled object, and reports the real,
per-object and aggregate counts.

T-2343 (Brunel) corrects three defects Poirot's review and Popper's
commissioning found in this script's own T-2338 form:

  - **S3 (Poirot).** The (translation-unit, object-path) pairing is now
    derived exclusively from `scan.enumerate_scan_targets(build_dir=...)` --
    design Sec4.1's own ruled single production membership entry point
    (fold round 34 gap (d), D-SLM4859) -- rather than re-implemented inline.
    A duplicate-stem manifest now REFUSES here exactly as it does anywhere
    else `enumerate_scan_targets` is called, instead of silently colliding.
  - **M3 (Poirot) / Sec5.4's 181-vs-627 reconciliation (D-SLM4861).** This
    script's own hand-picked four-flag compile line (`/std:c++20 /O2 /W4
    /fp:precise /EHsc`) was a THIRD, unshipped configuration -- neither the
    plain dev build.bat path nor the real `windows-latest` CI leg's own
    CMake Release build. `cmake.exe` is not installed in this environment
    (confirmed this session, `where cmake` empty on every PATH entry and
    every well-known install location), so this script cannot literally
    shell out to `cmake --build --config Release` the way the design's own
    ruling names as the ideal. What it does instead, to avoid a SECOND
    hand-maintained flag string duplicating what CMakeLists.txt already
    declares: it PARSES the `superslm` target's own `target_compile_options`
    line out of the real `CMakeLists.txt` at run time (`_msvc_target_flags`,
    below) and combines it with CMake's own documented, unoverridden MSVC
    Release default (`/MD /O2 /Ob2 /DNDEBUG` -- confirmed at source this
    fold, D-SLM4861: CMakeLists.txt sets no CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE or
    CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY override anywhere). A future edit to
    CMakeLists.txt's own `/W4 /fp:precise` line is picked up automatically;
    only the CMake-internal Release default (a fact about the generator,
    not about this repository's own text) remains a stated constant.
  - **Gap (a)/(b) (design Sec4.1 fold round 34).** A `corpus_symbols` index
    is built once (every function-typed symbol name in every compiled
    object) and threaded through every `scan_object` call, and the
    aggregate is computed via `ci_gate_corpus`, not by hand-summing
    ACCEPT/REJECT counts.

T-2348 (Brunel) closes 8a28460-t2344's own M3, routed back rather than
folded into the paragraph above (that paragraph describes the prior round's
own remedy; this one is this round's own correction to it, per this
project's accretive-note convention): `_production_compile_flags`'s own
docstring claimed the real CI leg's invocation is "derived rather than
restated" while four flags were still hand-written in `_compile_all`
(`/nologo /c /std:c++20 /EHsc /Iinclude`) and CMake's own unconditional
Windows-platform defines (`/DWIN32 /D_WINDOWS`) were omitted entirely. Of
those four, `/std:c++20` genuinely IS derivable -- `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`
is set at `CMakeLists.txt:7`, the same file `_msvc_target_flags` already
parses -- so `_cxx_standard_flag` now reads it at run time rather than
hand-restating the literal `20`. `/DWIN32`/`/D_WINDOWS` are CMake's own
documented, unconditional defines for any target under this generator on
Windows (a fact about the generator, not this repository's own text,
identically to the Release default below) and are now included as a second
stated constant. `/nologo`, `/c`, `/EHsc`, and `/Iinclude` remain
hand-written in `_compile_all`: none is a CMake-derivable project setting
-- `/nologo`/`/c` are this script's own compiler-driver invocation
mechanics (silence the banner, compile-only), `/Iinclude` mirrors this
target's own `target_include_directories(superslm PUBLIC include)`
(D-SLM4861's own established scope did not extend to include-path
derivation, and nothing in the corpus's own FP-instruction content depends
on which header search path resolved a `#include`), and `/EHsc` is not set
anywhere in `CMakeLists.txt` for this target under any generator -- it is
this script's own engineering choice to enable C++ exception handling for
a standalone `cl.exe` invocation outside CMake's own target machinery, not
a restatement of a project-declared flag that could drift.

Per `StandardsDocument.md` Sec5.4's commissioning rule, `check_fp_free_scan.py`'s
own verdicts are QUARANTINED until independently commissioned -- this
script's REJECT/ACCEPT/`ci_gate_corpus` readings are reported as what the
instrument returns, never boarded as an answer about the corpus's actual
FP-freedom, and wiring this script (or a successor) into an actual CI job
step under `.github/workflows/` so a REJECT anywhere fails a real pipeline
is a separate, CI-configuration task this script does not perform (design
Sec4.1's own text: "a scan this design specifies and nothing in the
pipeline runs is not a gate").

Process exit code (T-2348, Brunel, corrected per 8a28460-t2344's own S3):
`0 if ci_gate_corpus(...) else 1` whenever the corpus was actually compiled
and scanned -- reflecting design Sec4.1's own ratified contract, "the
production driver's own process exits nonzero whenever [ci_gate_corpus]
returns False, exactly as ci_gate's own guarantee (ii) states for the
per-object case." `0` when the toolchain is genuinely absent (nothing was
scanned, so there is no gate reading to report) -- the whole-corpus claim
stays "[U]" for that disclosed, named reason, not a script bug; this
script's own caller (`build.bat`) invokes it non-gating regardless of this
exit code (StandardsDocument.md Sec5.4: `check_fp_free_scan.py`'s verdicts
stay QUARANTINED until independently commissioned, so nothing outside this
script's own reported output currently acts on this exit code) -- per
Poirot's M4 (report the exit code, don't swallow it; don't let non-gating
mean unobserved).
