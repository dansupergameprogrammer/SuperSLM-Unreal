"""CI source check: include/superslm/checked_chain_funnel.h does not describe
`CheckPositionOverCap` as a "stub".

WHY THIS EXISTS. `CheckPositionOverCap`'s own body (checked_chain_funnel.cpp)
is a complete, correct comparison -- verified by execution on 32 operand
pairs including both int64 extremes, zero disagreements with `[0, cap)`
(Claude/Poirot/ad6bd09-s3.3-remediation-confirmation-review-2026-07-28.md
finding D). Its own declaration comment, forty lines below the file's opening
summary block, describes it accurately. The opening summary block does not:
it calls the function "a standalone predicate stub for S3.3's own
still-unbuilt position-cap gate" -- the same self-contradicting shape as the
prior round's finding 4, in the same header, introduced by the repair FOR
finding 4. The word to change is "stub"; the predicate is built. Its wiring into a
real forward call site is RopeApplySite's own first act, in S3.3
(D-SLM376, 2026-07-28, overturning this header's own prior "S3.6's own
job" routing -- D-SLM383 found the stale text one day later and D-SLM385
corrected it, along with three sibling comments in the same header and its
.cpp) -- and this check does not claim otherwise: it pins only that the
header stops describing an already-real, already-verified function as
unbuilt.
