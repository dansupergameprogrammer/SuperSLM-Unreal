"""Curie's regeneration gate for gen_s3_2_fixtures.py
(SuperSLM_S3a_WalkingSkeleton_Plan.md Sec11 S3.2).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Same shape as
test_gen_s3_1_c30_iexp_domain_sweep_fixtures_regenerates.py's own precedent: the
generated header's own line states "Re-running this script must reproduce this
file byte-for-byte", and nothing in the tree checked that claim before this
file. `.github/workflows/tests.yml` sits outside this campaign's writable scope
(D:\\SuperSLM\\tests\\ only), so this gate lives under tests/ci/ instead --
`python -m pytest tests/ci/ -v` already collects and runs every module here on
every CI invocation, so the gate runs the moment it lands, with no separate
CI-wiring step to add or forget.

MECHANISM. Calls the generator's own `generate()` -- never `main()`, which
writes to disk -- and compares its output, in memory, against the committed
header. Also re-runs every one of the generator's own `build_*()` functions
directly: each raises `AssertionError` on its own if the mechanism it derives
against (the vendored reference's `i_sqrt`, `dynamic_scale_reciprocal`, or
`bias_reconcile`) stops agreeing with the claim the generator's comments make.
This is the D-SLM357 mechanism-claim proof for this pass's own authored work:
every claim the generator's docstrings and inline comments make (the F-S3-2
table reproduces; the site witness's root is reachable and genuinely diverges
at two elements and not at the third; R_a's own derived maximum is exactly
2**32, still a genuine property of the vendored C19 reciprocal independent of
any load-time gate -- T-1657 Poirot N-6, confirmation pass 5156477: the prior
"BIA1's bound is exactly INT32_MAX and is tight" claim was retired along with
the load-time gate it fed, M-2's own remedy, `build_bia1_bound()`; the C28 tie
witness is genuine and the wrong candidate disagrees only on the negative
sign) is an assertion inside the generator itself, so importing and calling it
here IS running that proof, not merely regenerating a file.

Line-ending normalization matches the S3.1 precedent exactly (this Windows
checkout has core.autocrlf=true; `generate()`/`main()` always emit LF, and
reading the committed file in default text mode reproduces the same
normalization `git diff --exit-code` already performs).
