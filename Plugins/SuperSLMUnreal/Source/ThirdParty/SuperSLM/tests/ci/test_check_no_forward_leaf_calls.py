"""Curie's red suite for check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py (SuperSLM_S3a_Walking
SkeletonPlan.md Sec7.3, Sec11 S3.1; T-200, Sec17.3 cell 5).

Mirrors tests/test_check_no_pow_operator.py's own convention (constructed scratch
files, never the real production tree, per StandardsDocument Sec4's population-
validation requirement: a check shown able to FAIL on a fault it exists to catch,
not only shown to pass on unchanged input) and tests/ci/derive_bad_alloc_
membership.py's temp-file discipline (every scratch file is created under
tempfile.mkdtemp(), never written into the working tree, and removed in a
`finally`).

WHY SCRATCH FIXTURES, NOT THE REAL FORWARD DIRECTORY. The mechanism cells below
(the eight banned-leaf rule-coverage cells, the input-coverage cell, and the
allowlist-control cell) drive the check against constructed scratch
directories standing in for "a forward TU," never against the real
src/forward/ tree -- exactly as check_no_pow_operator.py's own self-test
stands in for "a generator that reintroduced **" with a scratch copy rather
than editing the real generator. This holds independent of whether real
forward-composition source exists: a real, unmodified
src/forward/checked_chain_funnel.cpp is not expected to name a banned leaf, so
scanning it alone could never show the check FAILING on a fault it exists to
catch (StandardsDocument Sec4's population-validation requirement -- a check
shown only to pass on unchanged input is not shown to catch anything). The
three cells the plan's own S3.1 red-cell list names --

    "a forward TU naming a leaf directly fails the CI check; a scratch TU
    added to the forward target and naming a banned leaf also fails it (input
    coverage); the funnel's own file and the leaf certification TUs pass
    (allowlist control)"

-- are realized here against those constructed scratch directories. The one
cell the scratch-only suite cannot realize is that the real glob and the real
allowlist, unmodified, agree on the real file that exists today -- the WIRING,
not the mechanism; that cell is realized separately, against the real tree, by
this module's own test_main_end_to_end_against_the_real_default_glob_is_no_
longer_vacuous (see its own docstring for why it is kept apart from the
mechanism cells above).

def test_main_end_to_end_against_the_real_default_glob_is_no_longer_vacuous():
    """UPDATED 2026-07-28 (S3.1 header-contract build, commit 32aca0c): this cell
    used to name and assert a vacuous pass (no forward-composition source existed
    in the real tree yet, Sec11 placing it at S3.2-S3.9). That premise no longer
    holds -- `src/forward/checked_chain_funnel.cpp` now exists and is the exact
    file the default glob was written in anticipation of. This test asserts the
    real, current state instead of the historical one: the default glob matches a
    nonempty, exact population (never grows silently uncounted -- a real
    forward-composition file landing without a matching update here is caught by
    the equality assertion, not just a >0 check), and the real production tree
    passes the check end-to-end.

    UPDATED AGAIN 2026-07-28 (S3.2 header-contract build, commit a594dd2, closed
    by this Curie pass): a second real forward-composition file,
    `src/forward_sites.cpp`, landed outside `src/forward/` -- exactly the
    situation the paragraph above named as "revisit again." The fix is not
    `len(files) > 0` (that would stop this cell from ever catching an
    unaccounted-for population change again, which is the whole property this
    cell exists to hold); it is naming the real, current set explicitly, sized to
    N rather than hardcoded to one. `cnfl._EXPECTED_REAL_FORWARD_FILES` is that
    named set, updated in the same commit that widened `_DEFAULT_FORWARD_GLOBS`
    to scan the new file, so this cell's equality assertion and the module's own
    scan stay in agreement rather than one silently drifting from the other.

    The funnel's own file passes here because `scan_files` skips reading an
    allowlisted path's content entirely (short-circuits on the path match before
    opening the file) -- so this cell does not, and cannot, prove the allowlist
    exempts real banned-leaf content; that half is proven by
    `test_the_funnels_own_file_and_leaf_certification_tus_pass_the_allowlist_control`
    against constructed scratch content standing in for it, per
    StandardsDocument Sec4's population-validation requirement (a vacuous
    production scan proves nothing; every other cell in this suite drives the
    mechanism directly). `src/forward_sites.cpp` is NOT allowlisted, so this cell
    DOES exercise real content through it -- it passes only because the file's
    real content today (S3.2's deliberately-wrong stub bodies) names no banned
    leaf, confirmed by direct read, not assumed.

    Revisit again the moment a third real forward-composition file lands, or the
    moment `src/forward_sites.cpp` is relocated under `src/forward/` (at which
    point it is matched by the directory glob on its own and its explicit entry
    in `_DEFAULT_FORWARD_GLOBS`/`_EXPECTED_REAL_FORWARD_FILES` becomes
    redundant, not wrong): this exact-match assertion will fail, correctly, and
    should be updated to name the new/moved file rather than loosened to
    `len(files) > 0`."""

#      inner();`). Against the REAL production file (compiled with its real
#      #include chain, exactly as the funnel's own file always is), the AST
#      mechanism finds both doors correctly -- proven directly below. Against
#      a FULLY DECLARATION-FREE scratch fixture with no #includes at all
#      (every type and identifier unresolved), Clang's error-recovery cannot
#      construct any body at all for the lambda's own `operator()` when its

#      unresolved call -- a residual specific to that adversarial,
#      declaration-free construction, not to the mechanism's use against
#      real code (which is what Sec7.3a's own property actually protects:
#      the funnel's real, always-fully-declared file). Not added as a
#      population member because it does not reflect how the real funnel
#      file is built, and is not one of the three shapes this review named.
#   2. A local variable shadowing a banned leaf's name inside a door's body
#      (`int64_t DynamicScaleReciprocal = d; return DynamicScaleReciprocal;`)
#      -- both the T-1378 scanner (a raw identifier match) and the AST
#      mechanism (which does not discriminate a variable DeclRefExpr from a
#      function DeclRefExpr by kind) treat this as a hit, consistently. Not

    equality, so a container that stops being a non-empty `str`-keyed dict --

    the name-matched set (every module-level name matching
    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN`) against the same pin for containment
    (`<=`, not equality -- T-1506), so an on-convention container that is a
    `list`, a `tuple`, or a `dict` keyed by non-`str` values -- invisible to
    the shape check because it is never a `str`-keyed dict -- fails this
    cell too, because its name is new and unlisted, while a container
    registered under a name the pattern does not match is never required to
    appear in this set and so does not fail it (T-1501, T-1506; measured
    against mutations constructed on-convention as a `list`, a `tuple`, and
    an `int`-keyed `dict`, each escaping the shape check alone and each
    caught by the name check; and against mutations that register an
    off-convention container by the two-edit rule alone, which require no
    third edit to `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` or to the container's own
    name -- T-1515: the stated total is still a third edit when the
    container is non-empty, on-convention or off, which is symmetric and not
    a defect the "two edits" framing ever claimed to remove; see mutations
    Y1 and Y2 in Poirot 03a9413-t1506-t1507-confirmation-2026-07-31.md).
    Both assertions are `_t1_check_population_registration`'s (T-1514); the
    T-1514 cells below pin the two assertions' behaviour directly against
    constructed namespaces, including the residual direction above -- a
    name the pattern does not match, bound to a value the shape check does
    not reach, is admitted by neither assertion (T-1517; mutations Q, R, S,
    T; a widening of `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` that starts admitting one
    of those names turns the corresponding cell red) -- rather than leaving

    `further_sweep_total` is NOT derived -- it sums four literals for five
    documented one-off cases that were never stored in a container, so
    neither check above can see them: T-1381's `+ 1` string-literal control
    (one case), T-1381's further-sweep `+ 2` (two cases -- lambda-in-real-code
    and shadowing-variable, both in the same literal), T-1383's `+ 1`
    function-pointer case, and T-1386's `+ 1` declared-code confirmation. A
    new one-off case added to this list without also incrementing
    `further_sweep_total` below is a shape this structure does not catch --
    inherent to a hand-summed literal bucket rather than a gap in container
    discovery, and not closed by T-1484's, T-1489's, or T-1501's fixes
    (documented rather than closed, per T-1467's remedy options). A second,
    independent shape also escapes both checks above: a container that is
    off-convention in its name and is not a non-empty module-level dict
    keyed by `str` -- an off-convention `list` or `tuple`, for instance --
    matches neither the shape predicate nor the name pattern, because it is
    absent from both sets the two assertions compare (T-1501; Poirot

    escape stays uncaught by design -- it is not a claim the two assertions
    enforce -- but the T-1517 cell following `_t1_failing_assertion` below
    pins its behaviour under `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` as shipped, so a

    turns that cell red instead of leaving the escape's stability to be

#: ee896a8-t1540-t1542-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Finding 4): a tuple of
#: `(name, on_convention)` pairs, not a `dict` -- a non-empty `str`-keyed
#: module-level `dict` is discovered by `_t1_discover_population_containers`
#: and would have to be registered in `_T1_EXPECTED_CONTAINER_NAMES` to keep
#: `test_population_count_is_stated` green, which puts a test-support
#: constant into the population pin; a tuple is invisible to that shape net,
#: and none of the module-level NAMES this constant introduces -- the tuple
#: itself and the five it is unpacked into, as distinct from the name
#: strings they hold -- matches `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN`, so it
#: is invisible to the name net too. `test_fixture_family_convention_
#: matches_its_stated_convention` below parametrizes directly off this
#: tuple; the cells that use each off-convention family as their fixture
#: reference the unpacked name below rather than repeating the literal, so a
#: rename of a family's name in this tuple moves every cell that uses it
#: together, and a rename that is not paired with the matching
#: `on_convention` flag is caught by the parametrized cell itself (the
#: renamed string is checked against `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` directly).
#: `_T9999_NEW_SHAPES`, the on-convention entry, is not referenced by name
#: elsewhere from this tuple -- any name matching
#: `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` is equally on-convention, so the cells that
#: use it for other mutation-battery rows are not coupled to this specific
#: string the way the four off-convention homes are.

#: so `_T1_ORPHAN_FIXTURE` meant "row 1" rather than "`_ORPHAN_CASES`", and a
#: pure two-row reorder -- no rename, no flag change -- silently repointed
#: four cells and dropped the residual cell's measured W-E discrimination from
#: four red to none, at a full 70 green. Binding by role makes a reorder inert
#: and a removed role loud (`_t1_family` raises at import), and
#: `test_each_fixture_family_role_is_bound_to_its_documented_name` below pins
#: the role-to-name map itself, which nothing previously asserted.

    the part of these statements most likely to be edited -- T-1506 changed
    it once already -- and matching the whole expression means an operator
    edit alone, with the subject and the property it breaks unchanged,
    misattributes the failure to every cell that fails at the edited
    assertion and then asks this function which one raised, rather than to
    the one cell whose property the edit actually breaks (T-1542; Poirot
    8762a30-t1517-t1518-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Minor 2 -- a namespace in
    this file is a mapping of names to values and contains no statement
    text; what actually misattributes is that a cell failing at the edited
    assertion, having asked this function which one raised, gets
    `unrecognized failing statement` once the source no longer matches the
    literal -- not every cell that merely reaches the assertion, since a
    cell that reaches and passes it never calls this function at all).
    Verified against the exact T-1506 regression (`name_matched <= pin`
    reverted to `== pin`): of the ten CASES, across four cells, that reach
    the edited assertion (T-1569 -- the unit was previously stated as

    that fails under the regression without calling this function at all;
    the remaining 5 cases reach the assertion, pass it, and never call this
    function either.

    Matching the subject name alone leaves all four misattributed cases
    GREEN and reds exactly one cell -- the must-not-raise cell named just

    four go green -- is pinned by
    `test_subject_name_matching_empties_the_misattributed_population` below,
    with the superseded full-expression predicate beside it as the control.
    The counts themselves stay a recorded measurement: reproducing them needs
    the suite re-run under the regression, which is pytest-in-pytest. Pinned

    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` as shipped, bound to a value that is not a
    non-empty `str`-keyed dict, is invisible to both assertions -- absent
    from the shape-discovered set because of its shape, absent from the
    name-matched set because of its name -- which is the residual
    `test_population_count_is_stated`'s own docstring names and this cell
    now pins directly rather than leaving it to be inferred from every
    other cell's contrast.

    This is the one direction in this file that exercises
    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN`'s admission side through the population-
    registration contract itself: every other cell here supplies a name the
    pattern already matches, or an off-convention name. Each fixture
    family's own convention -- on or off -- is asserted directly against the
    pattern by `test_fixture_family_convention_matches_its_stated_convention`

    to prose. `_ORPHAN_CASES` is chosen for this cell because it does not
    match the pattern as shipped but does match both a broad widening
    (`^_[A-Z0-9_]*(CASES|SHAPES)$`) and a plausible convention extension
    (adding a `_[A-Z]+_CASES` alternative) -- measured directly: widening
    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` either way turns this cell red, because
    the name then joins the name-matched set while remaining absent from
    the pin; narrowing the pattern leaves it green, because this class was
    never reached by shape. No cell before this one changes verdict under a
    widening of the pattern; four change verdict under a narrowing --

    Poirot 8762a30-t1517-t1518-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Significant 1 --
    the un-built third clause of the T-1517 ticket in
    `Claude/Poirot/da69def-t1514-t1515-confirmation-2026-07-31.md`, which
    asked for exactly this: "assert each fixture's convention against the
    pattern directly, so a cell whose docstring says 'off-convention' fails
    when its name stops being off-convention"). Both the parametrization and
    the four off-convention fixtures' own occurrences below are read from
    `_T1_FIXTURE_FAMILIES` (T-1551; Poirot
    ee896a8-t1540-t1542-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Finding 4), rather than
    each repeating the family's name as a separate literal, so a rename of a
    family's name in that tuple moves every cell using it together, and a
    rename left unpaired with its `on_convention` flag is caught by this
    cell itself rather than left silently stale.

    `_T9999_NEW_SHAPES` is the on-convention fixture used throughout this
    file's T-1514 cells above -- not coupled to this tuple's entry the way
    the four off-convention names are, because any name matching
    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` serves those cells equally.
    `_ORPHAN_CASES` is
    `test_registration_admits_the_documented_off_convention_wrong_shape_
    residual`'s fixture, above, and also
    `test_registration_rejects_a_dict_absent_from_the_pin`'s
    `off-convention-name` case. `_CONTROL_CASES` is
    `test_registration_admits_an_off_convention_container_present_in_the_
    pin`'s fixture. `_PHANTOM_CASES` is the W2, W3, W4 and W5 cases and
    `_T9999_RENAMED_SHAPES` is the O2 case, both in
    `test_registration_rejects_a_pinned_name_absent_from_the_namespace`
    above -- every one of those cells' own id or docstring calls its
    fixture off-convention, and none of those cells is sensitive to a
    widening of the pattern that starts admitting its own fixture's name,
    because none of them exercises the pattern's admission side (only
    `test_registration_admits_the_documented_off_convention_wrong_shape_
    residual` does, and only for `_ORPHAN_CASES`). This cell closes that:
    a widening that starts admitting any of the four off-convention names
    turns this cell red directly, independent of whether that widening also
    changes any other cell's verdict.

    Measured against all four widenings named or derived for this ticket,
    each applied by literal substitution to the real
    `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` line, the file's full suite run, and the
    file restored and SHA-256-verified afterward: the three
    `Claude/Poirot/8762a30-t1517-t1518-confirmation-2026-07-31.md`
    Significant 1 (closed, T-1518) names -- `^(_POPULATION_CASES|_T\\d+_(NEW|RENAMED)_
    SHAPES)$`, `^(_POPULATION_CASES|_T\\d+_NEW_SHAPES|_CONTROL_CASES)$`, and
    `^(_POPULATION_CASES|_T\\d+_NEW_SHAPES|_PHANTOM_CASES)$` -- each admit
    exactly one of `_T9999_RENAMED_SHAPES`, `_CONTROL_CASES`, or
    `_PHANTOM_CASES` and turn exactly that one case in this cell red,
    leaving this cell's other four cases and the file's other 65 cells
    green. A fourth widening, not named in that casebook,
    `^_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_(CASES|SHAPES)$`, admits all four off-convention
    names in this cell's own parametrization at once -- including
    `_ORPHAN_CASES` -- and turns all four of this cell's off-convention
    cases red together, and also turns
    `test_registration_admits_the_documented_off_convention_wrong_shape_
    residual`'s four cases red, because that widening admits `_ORPHAN_CASES`
    too. This cell's on-convention case, `_T9999_NEW_SHAPES`, stays green
    under all four widenings, matching what `_T1_CONTAINER_NAME_PATTERN` is
    stated to admit as shipped.

    The rename axis (T-1551; Poirot
    ee896a8-t1540-t1542-confirmation-2026-07-31.md Finding 4) is closed by
    `_T1_FIXTURE_FAMILIES` above, measured two ways by the same literal-
    substitution-and-restore method: editing `_PHANTOM_CASES`'s entry to a
    new, on-convention name while leaving its `on_convention` flag at
    `False` -- an unpaired rename -- reds exactly this cell's own renamed
    case and nothing else, because every other cell that used
    `_T1_PHANTOM_FIXTURE` moved with the rename and none of them is
    sensitive to what the literal spelling is.

    The PAIRED direction -- name and flag edited together, the family
    genuinely changing convention -- was previously described here as
    leaving "no stale off-convention claim standing, confirmed by collecting
    the suite's test ids". **That was false, and the cited method could not
    have shown it either way** (T-1565; Poirot
    67eb223-t1555-fixture-family-single-source-confirmation-2026-07-31.md
    Finding 1): collecting ids searched for the old SPELLING, which is a
    different proposition from "no stale convention claim survives", and the
    ids it collected refuted the claim on their face. Measured then: four
    W-case ids read `off-convention` against an on-convention fixture at a
    full 70 green -- verbatim the condition this cell exists to close.

    Measured now, with the same paired rename applied to
    `_T1_FIXTURE_FAMILIES`: every id stating a convention is built through
    `_t1_convention_tag`, so all four move with the fixture and read
    `on-convention`; and
    `test_each_fixture_family_role_is_bound_to_its_documented_name` goes
    RED, which is the deliberate loud signal that a family's documented
    role-to-name map needs updating alongside the rename. One red and no
    silent stale claim, where before there were four silent stale claims and
    no red."""
