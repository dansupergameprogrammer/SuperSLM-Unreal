"""CI source check: the GPU-serial port's guard-count "structural closure"
claim (`include/superslm/gpu_layer_loop_guards.def`, `gpu_port.h`'s own
`GpuLayerLoopGuard` enum, `superslm_gpu.cpp`'s own `static_assert` beside its
guard ladder) is itself checked against `forward_sites.cpp`,
not merely restated three ways.

WHY THIS EXISTS (T-2055, Claude/Poirot/db73b22-gpu-serial-port-final-
confirmation-review.md, P1). T-2052 built `gpu_layer_loop_guards.def` plus a
`static_assert(GpuLayerLoopGuard::kCount == 9)` on both the `.def`-generated
enum and the pin round's own table-walk cell, and FOUR records then claimed
this closed CPU-guard-count drift as a class rather than a fourth hand-count
(the `.def` file's own header, `gpu_port.h`'s own `GpuLayerLoopGuard` enum,
`superslm_gpu.cpp`'s own guard-ladder `static_assert`, and build log §17.2).
It does not: **nothing in that apparatus reads
`forward_sites.cpp`.** The `.def` file is a hand-written mirror of one
reading of CPU's own ladder; `kCount` is generated from the mirror, not from
CPU; both `static_assert`s compare `kCount` against the literal `9`; the
table-walk cell hand-writes nine fixtures whose labels were matched to the
`.def`'s row order by eye. Falsified by execution (the review's own
"mutation A"): adding a tenth guard to BOTH `RunLayerLoopImpl` and
`RunLayerLoopGpu`, with no matching `.def` row, left the build green and the
suite at 33870/3, unchanged in every count -- neither `static_assert` fired,
no cell moved.

WHAT THIS CHECK ACTUALLY DOES. Extracts the DISTINCT `SslmForwardStatus`
values returned from three places -- (a) `RunLayerLoopImpl`'s own FULL body
in `forward_sites.cpp` (from the function's own opening brace to its own
real, brace-matched closing brace -- `extract_function_body`/`cpu_guard_
status_set` below -- with the four per-site arithmetic-rejection statuses
that legitimately live below the entry guards, plus `Ok`, subtracted back
out (T-2152 outside strike item 3a: two of the original six, `OptionGWide
RopeMagnitudeOutOfDomain`/`OptionGFusedLandingExponentOutOfDomain`, moved
into their own function, `LandTokenKVRow`, and are no longer text `RunLayer
LoopImpl`'s own body contains at all -- see `CPU_BELOW_GUARD_ARITHMETIC_
STATUSES`'s own header comment below for the full account); corrected
2026-08-14, T-2062, S2, from an earlier cut that stopped at
the first occurrence of `const int64_t position = seq.context_length;`,
a text marker a guard placed below it could silently exit past), (b)
`RunLayerLoopGpu`'s own FULL body in `superslm_gpu.cpp` (the symmetric twin
of (a) -- `extract_function_body`/`gpu_ladder_status_set` below -- with the
one device-capability rejection status that legitimately lives below the
nine-guard ladder subtracted back out; corrected 2026-08-14, T-2069, S3,
from an earlier cut that stopped at the ladder's own `static_assert`
line, the identical class of defect as (a)'s own T-2062 correction, found
one review later by aiming the SAME falsifying mutation at this side
instead), and (c) the `status_name` column of every `SSLM_GPU_LAYER_LOOP_GUARD`
row in `gpu_layer_loop_guards.def` -- and asserts all three SETS are equal.
Verified at source, today: all three are the same nine members
(`InvalidLayerBudget`, `InvalidContextCap`, `HeadDimGeometryMismatch`,
`KvHeadGeometryMismatch`, `WorkspaceTooSmall`, `InvalidHiddenCodes`,
`SequenceAlreadyComplete`, `PositionOverCap`, `KvCapacityExhausted`), so this
check is live and green from its first run, not a check that starts by
skipping itself.

A second, independent check pairs with the first: every `.def` row's own
`cpp_citation` (a `"file.cpp:line"` or `"file.cpp:line-line"` string, the
`.def` file's own third macro argument) must still resolve, at the cited
line(s), to a rejecting `return SslmForwardStatus::<status_name>` statement
in the cited file -- catching a citation left stale by an unrelated edit
that shifts line numbers, independent of whether the STATUS SET check above
would also have caught the same drift.

CORRECTED 2026-08-14 (T-2062, Claude/Poirot/a3d44e7-gpu-serial-port-ship-
confirmation-review.md, S2; D-SLM3195, superseding whichever prior decision
carried the "closes the class" claim about this module -- left as written
above, not rewritten, per this tree's own append-only discipline): the
paragraph above's own residual statement was honest and incomplete. It
stated one mutation the prior review had actually run and none other. A
SECOND residual existed the day this module shipped and was falsified by
execution one review later: the CPU end anchor,
`const int64_t position = seq.context_length;` (`forward_sites.cpp`,
`RunLayerLoopImpl`'s own guard/arithmetic boundary),
is the real point where today's nine guards end, but it is a claim about
CODE THAT EXISTS, not a boundary the language enforces -- a tenth guard
placed one line PAST it, with a status new to the set and no `.def` row,
was invisible to this check (`OK`, exit 0), because everything after the
marker was simply never scanned. **Fixed** (the review's own first, class-
closing remedy, chosen over the cheaper "document a second residual"
alternative): the CPU region is no longer marker-truncated. It is now
`RunLayerLoopImpl`'s own FULL body, found by real brace-depth counting from
the function's own opening `{` to its own matching closing `}` (skipping
comments and string/char literals, so no line of source can fool the
depth count) -- never a second text marker guessing where new code will or
will not land. The six per-site arithmetic-rejection statuses (plus `Ok`)
that legitimately live below the old marker --
`CPU_BELOW_GUARD_ARITHMETIC_STATUSES` below, enumerated at the reviewing
seat's own source read and stable across this arc's every round to date --
are subtracted back out, so today's real nine-member set is unchanged and
this check stays green on the unmutated tree. A NEW status appearing
ANYWHERE in the function -- guard region, arithmetic region, or a region
that does not exist yet -- now surfaces in the raw set and is caught,
UNLESS it happens to reuse one of the six subtracted names (folded into the
honest residual below, widened rather than left the same size the fix that
found the gap left it).

CORRECTED 2026-08-14 (T-2069, Claude/Poirot/b543abe-gpu-serial-port-ship-
reverdict-review.md, S3; superseding whichever prior record called the
paragraph above's own fix "class-closing" without qualification -- left as
written above, not rewritten, per this tree's own append-only discipline):
"class-closing" was true of the CPU side and false of the module as a
whole. Part (b) above -- `RunLayerLoopGpu`'s own guard ladder -- carried the
IDENTICAL defect, marker-truncated at its own `static_assert` line, for one
more round: falsified by execution, a new-status GPU-only guard placed past
that marker stayed green (`OK`, exit 0) while the identical guard placed
before it reddened -- the marker, not the guard's own domain, decided the
outcome, exactly the shape S2 was about. **Not a contrived placement**:
`RunLayerLoopGpu` already returns a rejecting status twice below its own
marker (`dev.available` (`superslm_gpu.cpp`) and
`MapModelGpuResidencyTierCheck` (`superslm_gpu.cpp`), both device-capability
rejections, `KvPrecisionUnsupported`), and T-2059 added two new enumerators
(`GpuAllocationFailed`/`GpuDeviceRemoved`) for exactly that region three
commits before this fix -- a third device-capability rejection carrying a
new status is the natural next addition, and the marker-truncated check
could not see it. **Fixed, the symmetric twin of the CPU-side remedy**:
`gpu_ladder_status_set` (below) replaces the marker cut with the same real,
brace-matched full-body extraction `cpu_guard_status_set` already uses,
subtracting `GPU_BELOW_LADDER_STATUSES` (`KvPrecisionUnsupported` originally;
T-2101 added a second member, `GpuGemmGroupArithmeticInvalid` -- the set's
own real size is `len(GPU_BELOW_LADDER_STATUSES)`, read from the set
itself rather than restated as a literal here, since this exact sentence
went stale once already the moment a second member was added) back out.
Verified at source: unchanged on the
unmutated tree. Verified by execution, both directions, against the real
files: the falsifying mutation now reddens; the same guard placed above the
old marker (already caught before this fix, and still caught after it)
confirms the fix changes nothing about the case that already worked. Both
directions are now permanent cells in this module's own test file
(`test_mutation_e_*`, mirroring `test_mutation_d_*`'s own CPU-side pair).

HONEST RESIDUAL, stated here for BOTH sides rather than left to a seventh
review to rediscover the shape of (the failure this finding is about is the
overclaim, not the apparatus, and restating that overclaim about THIS check
would be the same mistake with a seventh author): **a tenth CPU guard, or a
new GPU-side rejection, that returns a status ALREADY in the derived set --
including any of the four `CPU_BELOW_GUARD_ARITHMETIC_STATUSES` names or
either `GPU_BELOW_LADDER_STATUSES` name, now that both are subtracted rather
than out of scan range entirely -- would not change the set, and this check
would stay green.** The set-equality comparison this module performs cannot
distinguish "this function's own real body has exactly these returns" from
"...plus one more that happens to reuse an existing name" -- reusing an
existing `SslmForwardStatus` across two logically distinct rejections, on
either side, is legal C++ and produces no observable difference to this
check. **Also on both sides**: a status returned through anything other than
a literal `return SslmForwardStatus::X;` (a local variable, a ternary, a
function call -- `GpuAllocationFailed`/`GpuDeviceRemoved` (T-2059) and
`GpuOperationFailed` (SuperSLM 1.8.0) are returned through exactly such a
call, `ClassifyForwardFault` (`superslm_gpu.cpp`), today) is invisible
to `_STATUS_RETURN_RE` and therefore to this whole module, independent of
which side it is on (recorded, not fixed -- every guard in the tree today
uses the literal form, so the likelihood is low). What this check DOES
close, exactly as `RunLayerLoopGpu`'s own comment claims for the
`static_assert` it replaces in that role: a guard or rejection whose status
is new to the derived set but missing from the `.def` (the review's own
mutation A, run with a status outside the nine, e.g. `RopeTableTensorMissing`)
now fails the build here, wherever in EITHER function's own body it lands --
guard region or arithmetic region, ladder or device-capability check, before
or after either old marker. This module's own test file (`test_check_gpu_
guard_status_parity.py`) reproduces every case named above on both sides --
reddens on a new-status rejection anywhere in either function, stays green
on a same-status one anywhere in either function -- specifically so the
residual above is a measured property of this check, not a claim about it.

CORRECTED 2026-08-14 (T-2080, Claude/Poirot/94ebee3-gpu-serial-port-closing-
review.md, M1; D-SLM3241): a SEPARATE residual existed in the citation
machinery itself, orthogonal to the two named above -- `GPU_PORT_H_LWUWS_
CITATIONS` (below) was a hand-transcribed MIRROR of `gpu_port.h`'s own
citations, held in this file, and nothing checked the mirror against the
original: corrupting every citation in the header's own text left this
whole module green, since nothing here ever read `gpu_port.h` at all.
Fixed: `parse_gpu_port_h_citation_lines`/`check_gpu_port_h_citations_
match_table` (below) derive the citation POPULATION from `gpu_port.h`'s own
text and assert it equals the table -- an edit to either side that is not
mirrored in the other now fails CI. Proven by execution, on the real
files: corrupting all eleven ladder citations in `gpu_port.h` while leaving
this module's own table untouched -- `OK`, 48 passed before this fix;
`FAILED`, naming the exact eleven-line divergence, after it.

CORRECTED 2026-08-14 (T-2083, Claude/Poirot/42ecf79-gpu-serial-port-
round9-review.md, O34/O35): two further, narrower residuals inside the
citation machinery itself. O35 CLOSED: `GPU_PORT_H_LWUWS_CITATIONS`'s own
`DecodeStickyTag` range citation -- which read `superslm_gpu.cpp:583-601` at
T-2083, quoted here as the historical text of a citation T-2094 has since
DELETED along with the whole table, never as a live location to resolve --
checked two
ENDPOINTS' own content, not what was inside the range -- the range-end
needle, a bare `"}"`, was satisfied by 177 of the file's own 2,023 lines
(executed at T-2083), so a shift onto the wrong closing brace would pass it, and
deleting an interior `case` while preserving the file's own total line
count (executed: `case 13` removed) left both endpoints individually valid
and this module green, 54 passed, while the citation's own claim ("fourteen
statuses, THIRTEEN of them rejecting") became false. Fixed:
`decode_sticky_tag_status_set`/`check_decode_sticky_tag_range` (below)
extract `DecodeStickyTag`'s own real, brace-matched body and count DISTINCT
statuses directly, pinning the exact claim the range citation exists to
protect rather than two points near where it happens to sit.

O34 -- RETIRED as a residual, 2026-08-14 (T-2098,
Claude/Poirot/152035b-gpu-serial-port-substrate-removal-review.md, M2;
D-SLM3291). The paragraph that stood here reasoned, in the present tense,
about `GPU_PORT_H_LWUWS_CITATIONS`, `check_gpu_port_h_citations_match_table`
and a comparison of "SETS of line numbers" -- machinery T-2094 DELETED. Its
own body was a same-position SWAP of two citations' line numbers in
`gpu_port.h`, which left the set unchanged and this module `OK`; there are
no line-number citations in `gpu_port.h` any more and no set to compare, so
the defect it described cannot occur and the specification it carried
(a parser associating each citation with its own dated-correction
sub-section) is work nobody now owes. Left as a dated retirement rather
than deleted, per this tree's own append-only discipline: a reader who finds
O34 cited in an older record needs to land somewhere that says what became
of it.

THE SUCCESSOR RESIDUAL, which is O34's own defect generalized and is NOT
closed. `check_marked_citations` below checks a citation for EXISTENCE and
never for correspondence, so it cannot distinguish a correct citation from a
citation to a DIFFERENT REAL THING. Executed (T-2098, MUT-O): in
`gpu_port.h`'s own ladder enumeration, `InvalidLayerBudget`
(`superslm_gpu.cpp`) swapped for `WorkspaceTooSmall` (`superslm_gpu.cpp`) --
a citation now naming the wrong guard, both symbols real -- left this module
`OK`, exit 0. O34 was "a swap of two POSITIONS is invisible"; this is "a
swap of two LIVE SYMBOLS is invisible," the same class one level out, and it
is the price the existence-not-position convention is bought at. It is named
here, beside `check_marked_citations`'s own true claim that there is no
boundary a citation can sit outside of, because that claim and this residual
are about different axes and reading the first as covering the second is
what would make this module look more closed than it is: the SCAN is
complete and the RESOLUTION is shallow.

Modelled on this tree's own established CI-source-check convention
(`tests/ci/check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`, `tests/ci/check_checked_chain_
funnel_position_cap_not_a_stub.py`): a text scan over the real source with
comments stripped first (unlike a leaf-name ban, this module counts DISTINCT
NAMES rather than merely detecting presence, so a status name mentioned only
in a comment must not inflate the derived set -- verified by this module's
own test file), two-step CI wiring (`python -m pytest tests/ci/test_check_
gpu_guard_status_parity.py -v` then `python tests/ci/check_gpu_guard_status_
parity.py`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`), no line-number-hardcoded region
(the leaf-ban check's own "glob the whole tree" answer to the identical
class of fragility, applied here as "anchor on real source text instead of
a line count").

# project phase.
#
# UPDATED (T-2115, D-SLM3432, Claude/Poirot/6f60491-t2115-cmake-product-surface.md M2): the two
# obstacles this paragraph originally named as the reason CMake GPU compilation was a "real,
# larger engineering task" -- conditional D3D12/Windows-only linkage, and CMake never invoking
# `dxc` at all -- are both closed. `CMakeLists.txt` now builds an optional `superslm_gpu` library
# (`SUPERSLM_BUILD_GPU`, Windows/MSVC-guarded) and compiles every `src/gpu/shaders/*.hlsl` file via
# `dxc`. The waiver below is UNCHANGED and still correct: `superslm_gpu` is a library, not linked
# into any `add_executable` that compiles `test_main.cpp`, so the `"CMake: superslm_tests (GitHub
# Actions)"` scope this module derives is still hollow for the exact reason its own entry states.
# Wiring `superslm_gpu` into `superslm_tests` -- the remaining, larger step -- is still owed,
# tracked in `Claude/Brunel/t2115-cmake-product-surface-2026-08-15.md` Sec2, not absorbed here.

# Dan's own "prefer removing the defect class's SUBSTRATE over checking it more carefully" order):
# this module used to carry TWO separate line-number-citation systems -- `ProseCitation`
# (`(file, line, needle)`, checked by POSITION) for `gpu_port.h`'s own paragraph, and a
# four-hand-picked-chunk mirror of the identical shape (`SELF_CITATIONS`) for this module's own
# prose about `superslm_gpu.cpp`. Both were brittle by construction: ANY unrelated line inserted
# above a cited line moves every citation below it, which is what made T-2084's own S2 restoration
# (nineteen inserted lines) break twenty-one citations in one edit, and a chunk boundary is a place
# a citation can silently sit OUTSIDE the checked population, which is what let M2's exact defect
# (four stale citations, three stale line counts) hide outside `SELF_CITATIONS`' own four chunks in
# T-2091's own round (D-SLM3277's own S1 finding).
#
# The substrate is removed, not scanned more carefully. A citation in this tree's own prose is now
# ALWAYS a MARKED ANCHOR reference -- `` `Name` (file.ext) `` in prose, a backtick-quoted
# symbol/constant/member-access name immediately followed by its target file in parens -- checked
# for EXISTENCE (does `Name` still appear as real code in `file.ext`), never for POSITION.
# Inserting a comment anywhere in `superslm_gpu.cpp` cannot break an anchor citation, because
# nothing here reads WHERE `Name` sits, only whether it is still there. Where a symbol name would
# collide between two distinct sites prose needs to distinguish (`g_last_weight_upload_was_skipped`'s
# own four write sites, two of them byte-identical statements), a named `// ANCHOR:<name>` comment
# is placed at the target site instead -- `gpu_port.h`'s own citations name
# `lwuws_write_function_entry`/`lwuws_write_catch` this way (`src/gpu/superslm_gpu.cpp`).
#
# ONE mechanism now covers what were five: `find_marked_citations`/`check_marked_citations` below
# replace `ProseCitation`, `GPU_PORT_H_LWUWS_CITATIONS`, `SELF_CITATIONS`,
# `parse_gpu_port_h_citation_lines`, `check_gpu_port_h_citations_match_table`,
# `parse_self_citation_population`, `check_self_citation_population_matches`, `check_prose_citation`,
# and `check_all_prose_citations` in one pass -- scanning the WHOLE tree's own prose for
# marked citations directly, never a maintained Python-side population that could itself drift from
# what the prose actually states, and never a chunk list a citation could sit outside of. There is
# no longer a table to keep in sync with `gpu_port.h`'s own text, because the table IS `gpu_port.h`'s
# own text, read fresh every run. The old line-count-claim constant and its own check function are
# removed outright, not replaced: `check_decode_sticky_tag_range` (above) already pins the real
# claim that figure existed to argue for, directly at source, so the figure itself was never
# load-bearing (round 12's own O1, the cheaper alternative this round takes instead of building a
# third mechanism).
#
# Split-identifier detection (T-2091's own S2, `find_split_backtick_identifiers`/`check_symbol_
# integrity` below) is UNCHANGED in mechanism and EXTENDED in population: it already scans every
# backtick-quoted identifier split across a line-wrap, across the whole tree, with no chunk
# boundary -- exactly the shape S1's own remedy needed, generalized to marked citations too rather
# than duplicated. A marked citation split by a line-wrap is caught by `check_symbol_integrity`'s
# own split-shape match (the identifier half); `check_marked_citations` catches the wider harm --
# a NAME that is not split at all but simply wrong, renamed, or removed.

# join-then-scan matched 307 distinct backtick-quoted terms in this tree, the overwhelming majority
# ordinary prose/local variable names never meant to resolve against a symbol table; matching the

# Round 15 cut on `body.find("weights_resident;")` over UN-stripped text, so the boundary landed on
# a T-2080 comment 24 lines above the write it named, and the outcome of a structural derivation
# was decided by the wording of an unrelated comment: executed both ways by the reviewing seat -- a
# genuinely new rejecting return added before the residency decision left the count at 14 and the
# checker `OK` (MUT-N), while rewording that comment so it no longer contained the literal made the
# IDENTICAL return counted (MUT-N2, "real body has 15"), and a comment merely MENTIONING the
# fragment above the ladder collapsed the count to 1 and failed a correct tree (MUT-D). Stripping
# comments removes the comment sensitivity; matching the whole statement rather than the bare
# fragment removes the substring ambiguity. This is the marker-truncation class this module has now
# repaired three times (T-2062 S2 on the CPU side, T-2069 S3 on the GPU side, here on the count).
#
# Stated plainly, because the honest form is what the two prior repairs each had to add later: this
# is STILL A TEXT MARKER, not a language boundary. `find_matching_close_brace` is what this module
# uses when the boundary must be one the language enforces; a "returns above the residency write"
# region has no such boundary, because it is a claim about statement ORDER inside one body rather
# than about nesting. What the repair buys is exactness of the marker (a complete statement, in
# code, not in a comment) -- not immunity to a future edit that moves the statement itself.
_LWUWS_RESIDENCY_WRITE_STATEMENT = "g_last_weight_upload_was_skipped = weights_resident;"

# corrected wrong again, "fourteen" (T-2069), "fifteen" (T-2075/T-2094), then T-2098's own repair
# above fixed the MARKER but not the SHAPE-ENUMERATION this comment now replaces).
#
# T-2098's own fix (the two constants directly above) replaced a text-marker bug with a SOUND
# marker, but the derivation it repaired still enumerated the two return SHAPES that existed when
# it was written: a literal `return SslmForwardStatus::X;` above the residency write, and a
# `!= S_OK ?` ternary anywhere in the body. T-2101's own S4 remedy then added a THIRD shape -- a
# literal return, but inside a NEW catch clause, positioned BELOW the residency write -- and it
# matched neither term: not the literal-return term (wrong side of the positional cut) and not the
# ternary term (wrong shape). Derivation stayed at 13/14; the real count became 15/16. Invisible to
# the checker that exists specifically to keep this sentence honest.
#
# THE CLASS FIX: this derivation now ranges over the PROPERTY the prose sentence is actually about
# -- every return path that resolves the call while `g_last_weight_upload_was_skipped` has already
# been set to `false` -- rather than an enumeration of the return-statement SHAPES known at
# authoring time. The property has exactly two structural members, and neither is defined by what
# a return statement looks like:
#
# 1. Every return BEFORE the residency decision ever runs. The flag is still whatever the
#    function-entry reset left it (`false`, `lwuws_write_function_entry`), by construction, for
#    every one of these -- regardless of the return's own expression shape. Cut positionally on
#    `_LWUWS_RESIDENCY_WRITE_STATEMENT`, same marker as before; counted with a GENERAL return
#    regex (`count_any_return_statements`, below) rather than the literal-only
#    `count_status_return_statements`, so a future shape appearing ABOVE the write (a ternary, or
#    anything else) is no longer free either.
# 2. Every return INSIDE a catch clause. `RunLayerLoopGpu`'s own catch clauses -- however many
#    exist, of whatever exception type -- each call the shared `invalidate_residency_caches_on_
#    throw()` lambda (`superslm_gpu.cpp`) before every one of their own returns, so EVERY return
#    inside ANY catch body sets the flag `false` immediately before returning, whatever that
#    return's own expression shape is. Found by REAL brace-depth counting from each catch header's
#    own opening brace (`extract_catch_block_bodies`, below, built on the SAME `find_matching_close_
#    brace` this module already uses for language-enforced boundaries) -- a catch clause is not
#    identified by a shape marker at all, so a NEW catch clause of a NEW exception type is found
#    the same way an existing one is, with no per-shape update owed to this function ever again.
#
# Catches are OPTIONAL structurally (a function with none contributes zero from this term, not an
# error) -- only the residency-write marker is a hard requirement, because it alone establishes the
# region boundary the "before" half of the property needs; "zero catch clauses" is simply a fact
# about a function's structure, not a sign the derivation lost its anchor.

       the marker but its own returns belong to the BEFORE population semantically, since a throw
       reached before the residency decision ran; counting them again here would double-count the
       identical return statements) -- today exactly one, the async-submission-succeeded return
       (`return superslm::SslmForwardStatus::Ok;`, handing the caller an in-flight token) that

       through. It reads exactly `weights_resident`, same as every path in this category always
       has -- the decision already ran, nothing after it touches the flag again.
    2. Every return inside `RunLayerLoopGpuFinish`'s own body, comment-stripped, in full -- that
       function runs only once `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` has already made (and returned) its own
       residency decision, so every one of ITS returns also reads whatever `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit`
       already decided, never re-deciding or re-writing the flag itself (the flag is a
       `superslm_gpu.cpp`-file-scope `static`, read, never written, anywhere in `RunLayerLoopGpuFinish`).
       Counted whole (no marker cut needed -- the entire function is "after" the decision by
       construction, since it cannot run before `RunLayerLoopGpuSubmit` already has).

       body, comment-stripped, EXCLUDING its own catch-clause bodies (already counted once, by this

       identical `_LWUWS_PREP_RELAY_RETURN_STATEMENT` text, already counted once inside

       `return superslm::SslmForwardStatus::Ok;`, the identical async-submission-succeeded shape

    missing -- an environment/drift problem this check's own extraction logic cannot route around,
    matching `check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py`'s own `ClangUnavailable` precedent of raising rather
    than reporting a false pass.

    T-2094 (Claude/Poirot/2a937f5-gpu-serial-port-class-closure-review.md; D-SLM3277) removed the
    line-number-citation substrate entirely -- `prose_citations`/`self_citations`/`GPU_PORT_H_
    LWUWS_CITATIONS`/`SELF_CITATIONS`/`SUPERSLM_GPU_CPP_LINE_COUNT_CLAIM` and their own checks no
    longer exist. `check_marked_citation_scan` (below) is what replaces ALL of them at once: a
    whole-tree scan for `` `Name` (file.ext) `` marked citations, checked for existence, never
    position. Nothing here needs a real `gpu_port.h`/`superslm_gpu.cpp` fixture path threaded
    through separately any more, because the scan reads whichever files `marked_citation_scanned_
    files` names directly.

    `gpu_port_h_path` (T-2080, M1's own structural remedy) -- retained ONLY for `check_lwuws_path_
    count` below, which reads `gpu_port.h`'s own real prose to parse its two number-words. Pass
    `None` to skip both (fixture-driven tests with no real `gpu_port.h`).

    `check_decode_sticky_tag` (T-2083, O35) -- pass `False` to skip: this module's own small
    synthetic GPU fixture (`_GPU_FIXTURE`) ends with a CALL to `DecodeStickyTag`, not a definition
    of it, so `extract_function_body` would raise for every fixture-driven mechanism test the same
    way `gpu_port_h_path=None` exists to avoid; every REAL-tree call (`main()` included) gets it
    for free.

    `build_bat_path` (T-2088, S1's own structural remedy, build log §26) -- pass `None` to skip:
    fixture-driven tests have no real `build.bat` to scan. Every REAL-tree call gets the
    O11-gate-flag pin for free.

    `check_marked_citation_scan`/`marked_citation_scanned_files` (T-2094, S1's own structural
    remedy) -- `check_marked_citations` reads EVERY marked citation in EVERY scanned file's own
    prose, whole-file, no chunk boundary: this is what makes M2's own defect class (a stale
    citation sitting outside a hand-picked chunk) structurally impossible rather than merely
    covered more chunks. Pass `check_marked_citation_scan=False`, or an alternate `marked_citation_
    scanned_files` tuple, for a fixture tree with no real files to scan.

    `run_symbol_integrity_scan` (T-2091, S2's own structural remedy, build log §27) -- every
    backtick-quoted identifier split across a line-wrap, across `SYMBOL_INTEGRITY_SCANNED_FILES`,
    must resolve to a real symbol or sit in `SYMBOL_INTEGRITY_ALLOWLIST`. Reads six real files
    directly, so it too needs no fixture-path threading -- pass `False` only to isolate another
    check's own failure in a test.

    `check_lwuws_path_count` (T-2094, S3's own structural remedy) -- parses `gpu_port.h`'s own two
    number-words directly (`parse_lwuws_path_counts`) and compares them against `RunLayerLoopGpu`'s
    own real, structurally-derived path counts (`derive_lwuws_before_decision_count`/`derive_lwuws_
    after_decision_count`) -- no citation table, no hardcoded constant, on either side. Reads
    `gpu_port_h_path` and `superslm_gpu_path`; pass `False` (or `gpu_port_h_path=None`) to skip for
    a fixture tree.

    `cmake_path` (T-2091, class-B sweep, the execution-scope manifest; generalized by T-2094's S4
    to enumerate every `add_executable` target rather than one hardcoded name) -- `None` skips,
    same reasoning as `build_bat_path=None`. Every real-tree call gets `check_execution_scope_
    waivers` for free: any hollow execution scope not named in `EXECUTION_SCOPE_WAIVERS`, or any
    waiver naming a scope that is no longer hollow or no longer exists, fails the build."""
