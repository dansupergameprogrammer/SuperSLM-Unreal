"""T-1899 (Curie) -- Curie's own red suite for
check_no_optionG_fused_site_skip.py (T-1822 design Sec12's "-60 load floor"
cell, structural-absence half). Mechanism 2 RE-ANCHORED and its own vitality
suite REWRITTEN 2026-08-11 round 4 (T-1901 Critical 2/D-SLM2417, D-SLM2425).

Mechanism 1 (retired-symbol absence) still mirrors
tests/ci/test_check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py's own convention: driven against
CONSTRUCTED SCRATCH files under `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`.

Mechanism 2 (no conditional ahead of the dynamic gate) is now driven against
REAL-FILE mutations -- a COPY of the actual, real
`src/forward/forward_sites.cpp`, never a synthetic fixture. T-1901's own
finding (Critical 2): the prior version of this test suite validated the
checker's mechanism 2 against a scratch fixture carrying a marker line,
`(void) out_magnitude_exceeded_int64;`, that appears NOWHERE in real code --
"a population of one chosen by the rule's author", the exact failure
StandardsDocument.md Sec4 names ("a check shown able to fail on an injected
fault... says nothing about whether the rule set covers the defects that
actually exist"). Executed against copies of the real file, the checker's
PRIOR anchor (the literal string `out_magnitude_exceeded_int64`, six-line
backward look-back) reported CLEAN on both an injected exponent-conditioned
skip and an outright deletion of the refusal, because that literal occurs at
the real call site only inside a comment. This suite now reproduces both of
T-1901's own executed mutations against a real-file copy and requires both to
report RED, per StandardsDocument.md Sec4's own population-validation
requirement -- and confirms the real, unmutated tree still reports CLEAN, so
the re-anchored checker is not simply oversensitive.

Mechanism 1's own scratch-fixture tests are unaffected by this round's
re-anchor (mechanism 1's own anchor -- the retired symbol's literal name --
was never the defect T-1901 found) and are kept as they were.
