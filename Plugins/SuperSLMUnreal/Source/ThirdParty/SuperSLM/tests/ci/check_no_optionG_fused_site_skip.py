"""T-1899 (Curie, red suite for T-1894) -- structural-absence checker for
T-1822 design Sec12's "-60 load floor" cell, mechanism (2) of 2:

  "a tree-wide source scan of src/ for the retired symbol name and for any
  conditional wrapping the dynamic-gate call sites, asserted in the build's
  code review, PLUS the T-1898 probe re-run" (design Sec31.2.2's own text).

WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHY IT IS TEXT-SCAN, NOT AST. Two independent
population/assertion pairs, on the same "text scan, no AST" discipline this
tree's own check_no_forward_leaf_calls.py already establishes (that module's
own docstring: mirrors tests/test_check_no_pow_operator.py's convention):

  1. RETIRED SYMBOL ABSENCE. No file under `src/` may declare a symbol named
     `kOptionGFusedKvLandingExponentMin` -- T-1891's own spike-only pre-filter
     constant, explicitly retired (not repaired) by the design's own round-3
     fix (D-SLM2384/D-SLM2385/D-SLM2388): "no new production symbol
     comparable to the spike's own kOptionGFusedKvLandingExponentMin exists."
     A build that reintroduces a fused-site-specific floor constant under
     ANY name containing this exact pattern is caught.

  2. NO CONDITIONAL AHEAD OF THE DYNAMIC GATE, RE-ANCHORED 2026-08-11 round 4
     (T-1901 Critical 2/D-SLM2417, D-SLM2425). The prior version of this
     mechanism anchored on the literal string `out_magnitude_exceeded_int64`,
     with a fixed six-line backward look-back for an exponent-shaped `if`.
     Executed against the real built tree, that anchor matched only a
     COMMENT (the real call site passes `&exceeded0`/`&exceeded1` and
     refuses on `if (exceeded0 || exceeded1)` -- the literal string never
     appears in the actual conditional or the actual `LandingRescale` call),
     fifteen lines from the nearest real token, and the backward-only window
     could not reach code written after it regardless. An injected
     exponent-conditioned skip AND an outright deletion of the refusal both
     reported clean (T-1901 Critical 2). The corrected anchor: the two
     tokens the real fused call site actually contains --
       (a) `return SslmForwardStatus::OptionGFusedLandingExponentOutOfDomain`/
           `OptionGWideRopeMagnitudeOutOfDomain` (the two refusal returns), and
       (b) a `LandingRescale(...)` call passing `&exceeded0`/`&exceeded1` as
           its own seventh (`out_magnitude_exceeded_int64`) argument
     -- scanning the ENCLOSING BLOCK each anchor sits inside (every
     currently-open brace at that point in the file, walked from innermost to
     outermost via a running brace-depth stack), never a fixed line count.
     Two, not one, assertions now compose this mechanism:
       (i) PRESENCE -- each of the two SslmForwardStatus tokens above must
           appear, at least once, as an actual `return SslmForwardStatus::...`
           statement somewhere in the population (never inside a comment or a
           string literal, both stripped before matching) -- catches outright
           deletion, which a skip-condition scan alone cannot, since removing
           the refusal trivially satisfies "no skip condition found".
       (ii) WRAPPING -- for every occurrence found by (i), or by the
           `LandingRescale`-seventh-argument anchor, none of its enclosing
           blocks' own opening `if` (found via the brace-depth stack, not a
           backward window) may be exponent-shaped (`e_t`, `kv_landing_e_t`,
           `ExponentMin`, or a numeric literal in [-128,0)) -- catches a
           conditional wrapping the refusal at ANY nesting depth, not only
           within a fixed number of lines above it.

MUTATION VITALITY (StandardsDocument.md Sec4: a new structure is validated
against an independently-found population before it is trusted; a check
shown able to fail on an INJECTED fault, not merely to pass on unchanged
input) -- RE-DERIVED 2026-08-11 round 4 against REAL-FILE mutations, never a
synthetic fixture (T-1901 Critical 2's own finding: the prior vitality
fixture carried a marker line, `(void) out_magnitude_exceeded_int64;`, that
exists nowhere in real code -- "a population of one chosen by the rule's
author", the exact failure StandardsDocument.md Sec4 names). This module's
own test (tests/ci/test_check_no_optionG_fused_site_skip.py) now copies the
REAL `src/forward/forward_sites.cpp` to a scratch location, applies the two
mutations T-1901 executed by hand (an injected exponent-conditioned `if`
wrapping the refusal; the refusal deleted outright), and requires both
copies to go RED -- the real, unmutated tree must report clean.

Test-design record: Claude/Curie/t1899-optionG-red-suite-2026-08-11.md
(mechanism 1, retired-symbol scan, T-1899's own original authoring).
Re-anchor record: Claude/Poirot/407981b-t1900-optionG-build.md Sec6;
Claude/Vitruvius/t1822-activation-scale-remedy-design-2026-08-07.md Sec12
"-60 load-time floor", mechanism (2), round 4 text.

T-1900 FIX ROUND 3 HARDENING (Claude/Poirot/73841be-t1900-optionG-build-
confirmation.md): assertion (ii)'s WRAPPING check (above) only inspected the
`if` header's OWN line text for an exponent shape -- a header that HOISTS the
exponent test into a named local variable one statement earlier evaded it:

    const bool gate_active = lw.kv_landing_e_t_k[h] < -40;
    if (gate_active && (exceeded0 || exceeded1)) { return ...; }

`if (gate_active && ...)`'s own line names only `gate_active`, never the
exponent-shaped expression, so the header-only check stayed silent.
`find_dynamic_gate_skip_conditions` now ALSO treats an `if`-shaped header as
exponent-shaped when a local variable it references was itself assigned, in
the SAME enclosing scope (the anchor-adjacent `if`'s own sibling statements,
scanned from that scope's own opening line down to the `if`), from an
exponent-shaped right-hand side -- `_enclosing_block_has_exponent_shaped_local`,
below. Re-run against the full vitality set this round (build log): the
pre-existing injected-`if` skip and outright-deletion mutations still report
red, the NEW hoisted-local mutation now ALSO reports red (previously clean),
and the real, unmutated tree stays clean.
