"""T-2149 fold round 6 (D-SLM3601): the committed, structural validation
population for `tools/ci/check_matmul_avx_isolation.py`.

Three consecutive review rounds (T-2170 Finding 4, T-2171 Finding 1, T-2174
Finding 3) each found the checker's required coverage narrower than the real
variation, and each remedy was validated only against its own author's
mutations -- the specific failure mode StandardsDocument.md §4 names ("a new
structure is validated against an independently-found population before it
is trusted"). This suite retires that failure mode structurally: the
population at `tools/ci/matmul_avx_isolation_population.json` is the union
of every mutation named across all three casebooks, committed once, and any
future widening of the checker is required to reproduce green against the
*whole* population -- never a fresh subset the widening's own author chose.

Each population member materializes a scratch copy of this repository's
CMakeLists.txt / .github/workflows/tests.yml / tree (via `shutil.copytree`,
excluding the same VCS/build directories the checker itself never needs to
enter), applies the member's edit or new-file content, invokes the checker
in-process against the scratch tree, and asserts the exit code matches the
member's own `expect`:

- `"red"` -- the checker MUST fail (exit 1, a real hit reported).
- `"green"` -- the unmutated tree MUST pass (exit 0) -- the checker's own
  false-positive floor, checked alongside the true-positive floor so a
  widening that starts flagging real, unmutated project files is caught by
  this same suite.
- `"checker-failure"` -- removing/renaming the scratch tree's required
  workflow file MUST exit 1 via the `CheckerFailure` path (a distinct
  stderr tag), never a silent `OK`.

Wired into CMakeLists.txt as a second `add_test`,
`check_matmul_avx_isolation_population_vitality`, picked up by the new
`matmul-avx-isolation-guard` CI job (D-SLM3604) by name prefix alongside the
checker itself.
