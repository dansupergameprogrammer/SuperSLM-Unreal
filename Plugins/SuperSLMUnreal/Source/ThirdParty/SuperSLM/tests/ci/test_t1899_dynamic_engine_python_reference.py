"""T-1899 -- Curie's red suite for T-1894 (T-1822 design Sec12 "Option G's
own coverage"): the Python-reference halves of two cells --

  - "Engine/reference bit-parity": the fused K-landing output vs. a
    re-derived `dynamic_engine.py` reference computed at the coordinated
    (post-Option-G, land-after-RoPE) ordering.
  - "Microstep/whole-token parity, Python": `dynamic_engine.py`'s own
    `begin_token`/`decode_step` path and `forward_dynamic_vec` agree on
    which ordering runs for the same loaded model.

WHY THIS FILE IS RED BY IMPORT, NOT BY ASSERTION. `dynamic_engine.py` does
not exist on main@c6cfa03 at all -- verified this session
(`git log --all --oneline -- tests/reference/superslm_spike/dynamic_engine.py`
shows it introduced on the T-1519/T-1520 lineage and present today only on
branches descending from T-1891's own spike work, never merged to `main`).
The design's own Sec31.2's text reads it directly from that path ("Verified
at source this session, tests/reference/superslm_spike/dynamic_engine.py"),
naming it as an existing asset without stating that main lacks it -- porting
or authoring this module for production is T-1894's own build obligation
(the same "engine/tooling-integration tier, gated on infrastructure that
does not exist yet" disposition Claude/Curie/t1832-...-red-suite-test-
design-2026-08-08.md Sec1 already establishes for this suite's C++-side
sibling cells), not a gap in the Coverage Model itself.

This module is therefore authored to the SAME red-cell convention this
suite's C++ side uses for a declared-but-undefined symbol (`RopeApplyPairWide`
et al. in test_main.cpp's own T-1899 section): it imports the real reference
module by its real, final name and location, and is RED BY IMPORT FAILURE
until T-1894's build lands it. `pytest.importorskip` is deliberately NOT used
here -- that would SKIP the cell, not fail it, and a skipped cell reads as
"not yet run" rather than "red for a missing mechanism", the exact
distinction StandardsDocument.md Sec4's structural-enforcement law exists to
preserve (a check that can be silently skipped is not a check).

    corpus's actual maxima) keeps every derived site scale in a comparable
    range instead of drifting toward zero through the attention chain's own
    1/127 and 1/2^15 divisions -- also confirmed by execution: without it,

    `kOptionGComposedFusedK_Pos1=[127,58]`, execution-derived and
    cross-checked by `TestOptionGSelectionDispatch_EndToEndProductionPath`,

    Mutation-pinned by construction: the assertions below read the K-landing

    that ordering changes what value lands in the trace, which this cell
    reads directly, not a value this test's own body independently computed.
    Verified by execution this session (not merely reasoned): reverting the
    rotate-before-land order to land-before-rotate inside
    `_forward_dynamic_vec_layers` on a scratch copy makes the fused-model

    that is instead the NULL-configuration value (token_index=0, identity
