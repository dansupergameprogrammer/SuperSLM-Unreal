"""Scan the real archive a CMake build produced for a target, and fail if any
object member it contains carries floating-point arithmetic.

WHY THIS SHAPE. The question this answers is "does the shipped library contain
floating-point math?", and the only trustworthy list of what is in the shipped
library is the one the build system itself produced. Earlier versions of this
check derived that list by parsing `CMakeLists.txt` and then tried to prove the
derivation was complete; four successive attempts at that proof each had a hole,
because a derived list is only as good as the parser and the parser is what you
are trying to check. A later version globbed the object files CMake emitted into
the target's own object directory -- no derivation, but two sources of truth
(the directory, the archive) that a stale incremental build could let disagree
(design Sec4.1, D-SLM5034). THE CORPUS IS THE ARCHIVE (T-2381, Brunel, design
Sec4.1/Sec5.4/Sec5.5 fold round 40, D-SLM5034-D-SLM5039): the static archive
CMake actually links (`superslm.lib` on MSVC, `libsuperslm.a` wherever `ar`
produces one) IS the shipped artifact, read member-by-member by
`check_fp_free_scan.iterate_archive_members`/`enumerate_archive_objects` --
there is no derivation step and no second corpus for a future build-layout
change to desync, because reading the archive's own member table is reading
what the shipped artifact contains, not a claim about it.

FAILS CLOSED. An archive that cannot be opened or parsed, or that opens
cleanly but carries zero OBJECT-kind members, is an infrastructure failure
(exit 2), never a pass -- "nothing to scan" is what a mis-pointed build
directory looks like, and it must never read as clean. A recognized object
member with an unrecognized container format (e.g. a Mach-O-magic'd member)
REFUSEs per member -- `check_fp_free_scan.scan_object` already catches this
internally and returns a REFUSE `ScanResult` rather than raising (T-2343,
78535ed-t2339's own M2) -- so a single unrecognized member fails the job with
the failing member named in this driver's own output, never an uncaught
Python traceback propagating to the top of the process (design Sec4.1,
D-SLM5036).

THE GATE READS CHECKS (A)/(B) ALONE (T-2367, design Sec4.1/Sec5.5 fold round
39, D-SLM4985/D-SLM4996). `check_fp_free_scan.scan_object` runs checks (A),
(B), AND (C) and reports two per-symbol surfaces: `ab_verdicts` (checks
(A)/(B) only) and `verdicts` (the combined ab_accept-and-c_accept verdict,
unchanged). This driver's own pass/fail decision is a function of
`ab_verdicts` and `refuse` alone -- a call/tail-jmp edge check (C) cannot vet
(an external target absent from the vetted list, or a first-party indirect
tail jump) is reported below as a non-gating diagnostic, never as a build
failure. A genuine check-(A)/(B) violation still fails the job exactly as before,
with no open axis remaining: check (A)'s `p`/`vp` branch consults an
explicit, checked-in allow-list (`check_fp_free_scan.
_X86_P_VP_STRUCTURAL_ALLOW`), and an unvetted vector-register mnemonic
fails whether or not it is `p`/`vp`-prefixed -- D-SLM5155/D-SLM5156 (Dan,
2026-08-29) closed the previously-open question this paragraph used to
describe, when an unvetted `p`/`vp` mnemonic reached no named rule at all
and check (A) accepted it anyway. The allow-list is a frozen snapshot of
the vocabulary's own `p`/`vp`
naming-convention membership less a six-entry, individually vetted deny
list, not a fresh per-mnemonic re-derivation (D-SLM5229); an unrecognized
future `p`/`vp` mnemonic REJECTs by default, which is what makes the
freeze fail closed rather than the individual membership. Check (C)'s
retirement narrows what can fail checks (A)/(B) alone (a call/tail-jmp edge
check (C) alone used to reject is now a non-gating diagnostic).

THE ARCHIVE IS THE ONLY CORPUS -- NO FALLBACK (T-2385, Brunel, fold round 43,
D-SLM5100/D-SLM5101, correcting T-2381's own retained fallback found by
T-2382 finding S1/S4: the stated six-cell justification for keeping it
measured one cell at source, not six). `main()` searches
`find_target_archive`'s own four candidate locations, in order; if none
exists, this is an infrastructure failure -- the search is printed and the
job exits 2 -- and the object-directory scan is NEVER called. This design
has retired every other dual-corpus mechanism outright rather than keeping
the retired one as a named fallback (fold rounds 8, 10, 39, 40), and the
same reasoning applies here: a fallback means the two corpora can still
disagree on some future build layout neither author anticipated, which is
exactly the two-sources-of-truth shape the archive retargeting exists to
close. `find_target_objects` remains in the tree, unretired and
non-load-bearing, matching this design's own scrub convention for every
mechanism it retires (`run_fp_free_scan_real_corpus.py`, fold rounds
39/40): five read-only cells (three in
`tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/test_check_fp_free_scan.py`, two in
`tests/t2296-fp-free-open-red-suite/test_archive_gate.py`) still call it
directly against a build that already has an archive. The driver
function that used to wrap it for `main()`'s own use,
`_scan_object_directory_corpus`, is REMOVED (T-2388): unlike
`find_target_objects`, it had acquired zero callers and zero test coverage
anywhere in the tree once `main()` stopped calling it (fold round 43), so
the retention precedent above -- a retired mechanism stays because
something still exercises it -- did not cover it; keeping it would have
been dead code with nothing to catch it going stale against `scan_object`'s
own signature. Design Sec7 dimension 11's restored fortieth population
(D-SLM5099/D-SLM5103) grades exactly this contract: a build directory with
no archive at any candidate location must exit 2 regardless of whether its
own `<target>.dir` is clean or floating-point-carrying, because the
corrected driver never opens the directory to find out which.

WHAT IT DOES NOT ANSWER. Scanning is per-member and per-ISA. This module
reports what `check_fp_free_scan.scan_object` returns for each object member,
on the ISA named on the command line; it does not itself decide whether the
scanner is correct. The scanner's own per-symbol verdict is independently
commissioned on five production legs at a one-instruction floor
(`Claude/Popper/t2345-fp-scan-recommissioning-2026-08-27.md`); the
archive-based driver's own re-commissioning is a separate, owed obligation
(design Sec5.4, D-SLM5041/D-SLM5068/D-SLM5069) that this build round does not
itself discharge -- it builds the driver design Sec7 dimension 11's
thirty-seventh through forty-eighth populations grade, it does not stand in
for the re-commissioning those populations' own execution is.

Usage:
    python tests/ci/scan_build_output.py --build-dir <cmake-build-dir>
                                         [--target superslm] [--isa x86-64]

Exit codes: 0 every object's checks (A)/(B) accept, on every symbol, and no
object REFUSEs; 1 a checks-(A)/(B) REJECT or a REFUSE; 2 nothing to scan, the
build directory was not found, no archive was found at any candidate
location, or the archive itself could not be read (an infrastructure
failure, kept distinct from a scan finding).
