# T-2814, T-2825 (Curie) -- X3, the export slot's guard-vitality cell (plan Sec3.7 item 5 and item 6
# dimension 11; TE-266, D-SLM7313, widened to the whole C ABI by the T-2823 fold and the
# v1.6.0 schema-bound query).
#
# SINGLE-DROP MUTANTS. The runner enumerates every SUPERSLM_API slot in <Engine>\include\superslm\*.h and
# *.inc -- the C++ declarations and the C ABI's verb declarations (api.h's own definition, preprocessor lines
# and comment lines are not slots). The enumerated count must equal X2's expected set (the C++ entries of
# consumed_symbols.txt plus the header's C verbs, 63 at v1.7.0); a mismatch fails X3 before any mutant runs,
# so a slot the enumeration cannot see is reported rather than silently never dropped. Mutant k copies the
# headers into
# <Out>\mut_<k>\include\superslm with slot k's `SUPERSLM_API ` token removed, and runs build_x2.ps1 with
# that directory first on the include path. A mutant is KILLED AS SPECIFIED only when X2 fails at BOTH
# checks the plan names, each naming the dropped symbol:
#   - X2 EXPORTS differs by exactly one missing name and no extra one;
#   - X2 CONSUMER-LINK fails with LNK2019 on exactly that name (the consumer calls every listed symbol).
# Anything else is reported: SURVIVED (X2 passed) or KILLED-OTHERWISE (X2 failed some other way).
#
# HARNESS MUTANT (-Harness): the unmutated headers with the consumer built /DX2_DROP_CHUNK_BATCHED, which
# drops its one RunLayerLoopChunkBatched call. KILLED AS SPECIFIED only when EXPORTS are EQUAL, the consumer
# LINKS and RUNS, and X2 IMPORTS differs by exactly that one missing name -- the import-equality check is
# then the only thing standing between a harness that skips a symbol and a green X2.
#
# Usage: run_x3_mutants.ps1 [-Engine <root>] [-Out <dir>] [-Indices 0,5,...] [-Harness | -HarnessOnly] [-List]
#   -List        print the enumerated slots with their indices and exit
#   -Indices     run only these slots. Without it EVERY slot runs (63 mutants at v1.7.0),
#                whether or not -Harness is given.
#   -Harness     also run the harness mutant. -HarnessOnly runs the harness mutant and no single-drop mutant.
# The acceptance invocation is `run_x3_mutants.ps1 -Harness` with no -Indices: 63 single-drop mutants, the
# harness mutant, and the reconciliation (X3 RECONCILE: EQUAL). A run narrowed by -Indices or -HarnessOnly
# prints X3 RECONCILE: PARTIAL RUN and is never an acceptance run.
# Exit code: 0 when every mutant run was killed as specified and the reconciliation holds, 1 otherwise.
