// guards (mechanism cell 2, cross-cited to dim2, not duplicated -- dim2's own cells already
// assert this ordering by construction, this file names the obligation so dim11's own rollup

// the runtime, would emit the lowest-index token (argmax over an all-false mask degrades to

// catches what the compiler fails to reject. D-SLM40's own positive requirement: the runtime
// MUST NOT add a defensive all-masked check -- this cell's OWN existence would need to be
