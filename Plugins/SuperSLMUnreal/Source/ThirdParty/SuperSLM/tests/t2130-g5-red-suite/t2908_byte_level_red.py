"""T-2908 (Curie, T-2913) -- Sec3.9.3's three T-2908 cell groups: the structural UTF-8-validity
cell, the lone-continuation-byte dead-end cell, and the real-vocabulary fragment-reachability
cell -- plus Sec3.9.6's keyword-allowlist group (S3), folding TE-365 S2/S3.

STATUS (T-2915: the compiler port landed). This branch's own `tools/sslm_convert_schema.py`
now operates on raw bytes throughout: `_add_string_leaf`'s content sub-automaton is the
byte-level UTF-8-validity construction, and `_groups()` carries the per-branch keyword
allowlist. The structural UTF-8-validity cell (Cell 1) exercises the reference module directly
(a property of the NEW byte-level content automaton this port introduces, checked against the
one committed implementation rather than duplicated against the branch's own copy of the same
construction); Cells 2 and 3 and the keyword-allowlist group compare the branch against the
reference directly, and now confirm agreement rather than divergence -- each carries its own
pre-port mutant, reproducing the historical defect by construction, not by assuming the branch
still has it.

GREEN oracle: T-2908's own reference compiler, vendored in-repo (`reference/t2908-probe/
sslm_convert_schema_bytelevel.py`, `reference/PROVENANCE.md`), loaded via
`t2913_common.reference_t2908()`.

Real-vocabulary cells load the real Qwen2.5 tokenizer via this repo's own
`tools/convert_tokenizer.py` and FAIL LOUDLY (not skip) if the checkpoint is missing (T-2909's
fail-closed rule; `t2913_common._require`).

# T-2919 (TE-372 S3) correction: this docstring previously claimed "the branch's own compiler
# has no byte-keyed content states to audit this way at all", which was true only pre-port. By
# inspection of the shipped `tools/sslm_convert_schema.py::_char_dfa` (T-2915, T-2917), the
# branch's own `_char_dfa` now ALSO returns a byte-keyed `(dfa, start, accepting,
# content_states)` 4-tuple, identically shaped to this reference module's. This cell is kept on
# the reference alone -- it is an exhaustive structural audit of one committed module's own
# automaton (~11 states, ~0x110000 scalars), not a branch-vs-reference comparison, and per
# `reference/PROVENANCE.md` the reference module is a fixed historical artifact, not an
# independent oracle for the branch's own behaviour. The branch's OWN UTF-8-validity behaviour is
# exercised directly (not merely audited via a structurally-identical predecessor) by Cell 2
# below and by `t2899_string_leaf_red.py`'s escape/control-byte groups, both of which call the
# branch's own `compile_schema_to_mask_pages` and check its output against `json.loads`, an
# independent oracle.
