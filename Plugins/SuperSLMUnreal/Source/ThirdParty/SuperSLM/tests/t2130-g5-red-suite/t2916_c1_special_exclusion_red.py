"""T-2916 (Curie) -- TE-370 C1's red cells: special-token exclusion for the string leaf is
opt-in per caller, and the only shipped real-vocabulary producer does not opt in
(`Claude/Poirot/te370-final-code-review-2026-09-21.md` Sec2 C1, Wizard repo; probe
`Claude/Poirot/te370-probe/real_special.py`/`real_special_output.txt`).

At `0062c99`, `tools/t2132_build_g5_fixture.py::_real_vocab` returns `TokenizerTables.id_to_bytes`
unmodified -- every one of the real Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct tokenizer's 22 special/added ids
(`<|endoftext|>`, `<|im_end|>`, ...) is still spelled out as its literal ASCII bytes, which are
valid string content anywhere in the U/M regions of the string leaf's own content automaton.
Nothing downstream refuses this; `compile_schema_to_mask_pages` takes no special-id input at all.
Executed on the real tokenizer (Poirot's probe, reproduced by this file's own first cell):
22 of 22 specials admitted, each in 2 content states.

Two claims, per the brief (`Claude/Bach/briefs/t2916-te370-red-cells.md`):
  1. The shipped producer PLUS the shipped compiler admits ZERO specials, once fixed.
  2. The compiler REFUSES a vocabulary that has not been through the exclusion step -- the fix
     is structural (a caller cannot forget the step and still get a mask), so this cell pins the
     REFUSAL itself, not only the zero-admission outcome. Poirot's own remedy text names one
     concrete shape for that refusal ("e.g. a required keyword-only `special_ids` argument that
     it applies itself") -- adopted here as this test's pinned contract, since the finding does
     not name a different one and red-first authoring is exactly where a contract like this gets
     fixed before the build starts. If T-2917 lands a different mechanism, this cell is the one
     to reconcile against.

Both cells are RED at `0062c99`: cell 1 because 22/22 specials are admitted where zero must be;
cell 2 because `compile_schema_to_mask_pages(schema, vocab)` -- the shipped producer's own exact
calling convention, unzeroed -- succeeds today instead of being refused.

MUTATION PROOF (StandardsDocument.md Sec5.4): the "wrong version" is not invented -- it is named
directly as the commit TE-370 reviewed and ruled DO NOT SHIP over this exact finding, `0062c99`,
loaded via `t2913_common.frozen_module` (git history, no out-of-repo input). Until T-2917 lands a
fix, HEAD IS `0062c99` for these two files and the mutant class below reports PENDING rather than
fabricating a pass; once HEAD moves past it, the same class requires shipped to pass and the
`0062c99`-frozen copy to still fail on both cells.
