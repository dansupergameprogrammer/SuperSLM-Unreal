"""T-2130 (Curie) -- G5-1 schema compiler fuzz suite (design Sec6 G5-1's own red suite).

RED BY IMPORT (the Python analogue of this suite's own C++ files' RED BY LINK convention,
tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite/build_link_red.bat): `tools.sslm_convert_schema` is this file's
own plausible production import path, following this repo's existing converter-tooling naming
convention (tools/sslm_convert_adapter.py, tools/sslm_convert_manifest.py,
tools/sslm_convert_validate.py -> tools/sslm_convert_schema.py, undeclared at authoring time --
grep of tools/ confirmed no such module exists). Every test below fails at collection with
ModuleNotFoundError until the build seat lands G5-1's own compiler module. Design Sec4: "the
schema compiler is a converter component (offline Python tooling, like every other Sec11
converter stage)" -- this is why the production half is Python, not C++, and why this file
lives beside the C++ .cpp cells rather than compiled into them.

BUILD-TIME/LOCAL, documented as such (SETTLED, D-SLM3442/D-SLM3444) -- not a standing CI job.
Run manually: `python -m pytest tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/g5_1_schema_compiler_fuzz_red.py -v`
from a checkout with G5-1's own compiler module built. T-2121 N2's provenance obligation
applies regardless of build-time-only scope: the corpus's "generated schemas" half (below) is
produced by THIS committed, hermetic, seeded generator, re-run from a clean checkout and
reproducing the same corpus byte-for-byte (design Sec6 G5-1, the S-HARDEN-5 precedent).

	FIXTURE DEFECT, FIXED (routed by the G5 build seat, Claude/Brunel/t2132-g5-build-2026-08-16.md
	Sec "G5-1"; ruled at source by Curie, this file's own owner): the base charset previously
	omitted the a-z fallback characters build_vocab's own precedent includes
	('{}",:_0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', probe.py line 85), so two of the reference
	schema's own literals sharing a 6-character prefix ('"negate"' and '"negated_slot":') left a
	reachable DFA state with no vocabulary token able to spell the remainder after the shared
	prefix diverges -- a genuine dead end BY CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIXTURE, not a compiler defect: a
	correct G-7a-compliant compiler must reject it. Confirmed independently at this file's own
	source before the fix: the base charset below lacked 'a'-'z' entirely. The fix restores the
	single-character fallback coverage the docstring above already promised ("single chars as
	fallback") and this function's own code did not implement for letters -- the reference
	schema's real, satisfiable shape (D-SLM45: per-field enums/booleans/objects, no dead ends by
	its own construction) now compiles, which is the claim this cell exists to prove. The cell's
	own discriminating intent is unchanged: it still fails on a compiler that wrongly ACCEPTS a
	genuinely unsatisfiable schema (see the sibling class below,
	G5_1_UnsatisfiableSchemaRejectionGuardVitality, which constructs one on purpose and requires
	rejection) -- this fix only removes an unsatisfiability the FIXTURE was accidentally
	introducing, it does not weaken what the compiler is required to catch.
