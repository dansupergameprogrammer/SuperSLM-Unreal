/* sslm_g5.h -- T-2130 (Curie) red suite: the canonical declared surface for the G5
 * constrained-decoding engine.
 *
 * Transcribed verbatim from the design of record, Claude/Vitruvius/
 * t2119-g5-constrained-decoding-design-2026-08-16.md Sec5 (Wizard repo) -- the ABI surface
 * post rung-5 repair (T-2122/D-SLM3445) and rung-6 confirmation fold. Every G5-specific
 * declaration cites the design section it was copied from. This is the SAME promotion
 * discipline T-2112's sslm_gpu_1p0.h established (its own header comment, this repo,
 * tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite/sslm_gpu_1p0.h): one canonical copy in this directory,
 * included by every .cpp/.py fixture in this suite via `-I .`, never hand-patched out of
 * sync with the design -- regenerate this file from the design of record when Sec5 changes.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (routed as a finding, not silently resolved -- same shape as T-2112's own
 * SlmModelView-collision finding in its header comment): the design's Sec5 ABI is written
 * in the PLAN's own Sec12 API-sketch naming (`sslm_model`, `sslm_seq`, `sslm_prefix`,
 * `sslm_schema`, `sslm_prefill`, `sslm_seq_create`, ...) -- distinct from the ALREADY-SHIPPED
 * `SslmGpu*`-prefixed handle surface T-2107/T-2112/T-2113 built (include/superslm/gpu_1p0.h).
 * A grep of this repo's own src/ and include/ at this suite's authoring commit (main@f37be4a)
 * finds NO symbol under the `sslm_model_map`/`sslm_seq_create`/`sslm_prefill`/
 * `sslm_prefix_begin` names the plan's own Sec12 sketch and this design's Sec5 both use --
 * the Layer-1 C ABI the plan sketches has never been built under those literal names; every
 * shipped GPU-serial-port and S-LoRA-serial mechanism is reached through the `SslmGpu*`
 * handle surface instead. This suite is therefore written against the design's OWN Sec5 text,
 * not reconciled against the shipped `SslmGpu*` naming -- reconciling the two naming schemes
 * (or confirming the build seat intends a literal `sslm_`-prefixed Layer-1 ABI distinct from
 * `SslmGpu*`) is a build-time question for whoever prosecutes G5, not a test-authoring
 * decision Curie's own jurisdiction covers (Curie realizes the design's declared ABI in
 * tests; she does not resolve a naming question the design itself did not raise). Filed in
 * Claude/Curie/t2130-g5-red-suite-2026-08-16.md (Wizard repo).
 *
 * Every function below is therefore RED BY LINK against the real engine: this header
 * declares the surface, no .cpp anywhere in this repo (grep confirmed at authoring time)
 * defines it, so every cell that calls one of these symbols compiles clean and fails to
 * link (LNK2019), per this suite's own build_link_red.bat and the house convention
 * tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite/build_link_red.bat established.
 *
 * The pre-G5 Layer-1 primitives G5 extends (sslm_seq_create/release/reset/save/restore,
 * sslm_prefix_begin/freeze/release, sslm_seq_adopt_prefix, sslm_seq_set_adapter,
 * sslm_decode_step, sslm_stats) are declared here too, at the SAME plan Sec12 signatures,
 * because they are equally undeclared under these literal names in the current tree -- this
 * mirrors T-2112's own precedent of declaring more of the surface than just the new pieces,
 * for the identical reason (nothing exists yet under either name).

 * 4f4eb23896, Claude/Vitruvius/t2133-layer1-c-abi-design-2026-08-16.md Sec6 GOVERNANCE RULING:
 * "Sec6 is the COMPLETE ordinal registry for sslm_status; sslm_g5.h mirrors it verbatim rather
 * than owning a block", Poirot confirmation-pass casebook 2c18dab-t2139-abi-build-review.md
 * Sec7.4/P2, folded). This supersedes the prior "base low 0-17, G5 appended above at 18-24"
 * reconciliation (still visible in the per-enumerator comments below, which record each entry's
 * own history) -- SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED's ratification at ordinal 25 (past the 0-24 range, the
 * append-only law's own correct reasoning at the time) left the base family non-contiguous
 * (0-17 and 25) with G5's block (18-24) sitting INSIDE that range rather than cleanly above it,
 * and nothing governed who takes the next ordinal (26) from two independently-numbered blocks.
 * Sec6 closes this by becoming the single ordinal-allocation authority for BOTH families: base
 * enumerators and G5's schema enumerators alike are entries in one registry, assigned by Sec6
 * alone, never self-numbered by either header independently. Semantic ownership is unchanged --
 * G5 (design T-2119) still owns the MEANING of its own schema statuses; only ordinal allocation
 * centralizes. All 26 registry entries are carried here, verbatim, including
 * SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED at 25 (a prior gap in this header, closed this fold). Next-free ordinal
 * per the registry: 26 -- requested from and assigned by Sec6, whichever side needs it next.
 * Gate C's sslm_status exclusion lifted at the prior reconciliation and stays lifted -- the
 * per-enumerator check runs unconditionally over the full, reconciled enum. Gate C's own retired
 * "highest base enumerator strictly below first G5-only enumerator" ordering sentinel (false on
 * its own terms once SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED landed at 25) was NOT left retired -- FOLD RULING
 * 2026-08-17 (design Sec6, on Poirot's third confirmation casebook 4466666-t2139-third-
 * confirmation-review.md F1) reinstated a structural version of it: both this header and
 * include/superslm/sslm_abi.h gain a final enumerator, SSLM_STATUS_NEXT_FREE, with no explicit
 * value, so it auto-values one past whichever header's own last explicit member and moves itself
 * whenever either side appends -- see the enum body below, and Gate C's own generated per-name
 * checks plus the SSLM_STATUS_NEXT_FREE-pair static_assert this header's addition now makes
 * possible on the library side. */
