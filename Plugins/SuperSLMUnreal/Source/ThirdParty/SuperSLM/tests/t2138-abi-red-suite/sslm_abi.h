/* sslm_abi.h -- T-2138 (Curie) red suite: the canonical declared surface for the Layer-1
 * CPU-side sslm_* consumer C ABI.
 *
 * Transcribed verbatim from the design of record, Claude/Vitruvius/
 * t2133-layer1-c-abi-design-2026-08-16.md Sec8 (Wizard repo) -- the exact code block that
 * section ships, itself derived verbatim (Sec8's own stated method) from
 * tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h @ curie/t2130-g5-red-suite@760b12b for every verb that
 * header already declares: same argument count, same argument order, same pointer-vs-value
 * convention, per verb, with no re-derivation from plan prose and no per-verb normalization.
 * This is the SAME promotion discipline tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite/sslm_gpu_1p0.h and
 * tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h both established: one canonical copy in this directory,
 * included by every .cpp fixture in this suite via `-I .`, never hand-patched out of sync with
 * the design -- regenerate this file from the design of record Sec8 if that section changes.
 *
 * Every function below is RED BY LINK against the real engine: this header declares the
 * surface; no .cpp anywhere in this repo (grep confirmed at authoring commit,
 * main@e2feb7d0) defines any `sslm_*` symbol under these names -- D-SLM3450, the design's own
 * Sec1 grounding. Every cell that calls one of these symbols compiles clean and fails to link
 * (LNK2019), per this suite's own build_link_red.bat and the house convention
 * tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite/build_link_red.bat / tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/build_link_red.bat
 * both established.
 *
 * sslm_config AND sslm_detok_state -- ROUTED GAP CLOSED (design commit 41b72091c2, "T-2133:
 * micro-fold -- define sslm_config and sslm_detok_state field layouts routed from the T-2138
 * red suite's model gaps", Sec7.1/Sec7.4). This suite's own first pass (Claude/Curie/
 * t2138-abi-red-suite-2026-08-16.md Sec6) found neither struct given a body anywhere in the
 * design and declared both incomplete rather than guess; the planner ruled both bodies and this
 * header now carries them verbatim from Sec7.1/Sec7.4/Sec8:
 *
 * sslm_config (Sec7.1) is the call-shape declaration sslm_workspace_size/sslm_workspace_create
 * size the workspace against. ALL-ZERO IS HOSTILE INPUT here (every field is a required
 * positive sizing input) -- the opposite domain from sslm_detok_state below. Domain:
 * max_batch >= 1, max_chunk_budget >= 1, 1 <= max_layer_budget <= num_hidden_layers,
 * reserved == 0. A structurally invalid config makes sslm_workspace_size return 0 (its only
 * channel) and sslm_workspace_create reject SSLM_INVALID_ARGUMENT (re-validated independently,
 * never trusting the size_t call's return) -- dim2_hostile_red.cpp's own five sub-cells drive
 * this per field.
 *
 * sslm_detok_state (Sec7.4) is a fixed-size, caller-allocated POD value type (no create/destroy
 * verb, unlike sslm_workspace/sslm_kv_pool) holding a partial UTF-8 tail across successive
 * sslm_detokenize_stream calls. THE ALL-ZERO VALUE IS A VALID START STATE here (pending_count
 * == 0 means "no partial tail pending") -- the opposite domain from sslm_config above.

 * tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h) -- carried here in the SAME implicit-sequential-value style

 * IS the registry's own ordinal order, 0 through 28, then the sentinel).
 *
 * SSLM_RESTORE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH (ordinal 22) was previously named here as "explicitly NOT one of
 * these... reserved-but-unbuilt" -- that carve-out is retired by the symmetric-mirroring ruling
 * above: every registry entry is now declared as an enumerator VALUE this suite's own C1-C7

 * all. This copy has NO compile-time parity check of its own against either real header; it is
 * guarded only by the fact that the 564-cell suite this header serves links against the real
 * src/sslm_abi.cpp (tests/t2138-abi-red-suite/build_link_red.bat) -- and C linkage resolves calls
 * by SYMBOL NAME alone, never by re-checking argument or enum-value types across translation
 * units, so a divergence here (a wrong ordinal, a missing name) would NOT be caught by the linker;
 * it would silently pass the wrong int-valued status to a CHECK() that expects a different name. A
 * dedicated Gate A/C-style comparison against this copy is a suite-owned follow-up this fold does
