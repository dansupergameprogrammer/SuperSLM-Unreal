//     SslmGpuModelHandle are compile-time-distinct incomplete-struct pointer types with no
//     implicit C conversion) is N/A-with-reason: a caller passing one where the other is
//     expected fails to COMPILE, so no runtime cell is owed (design Sec10 dim7, verbatim).
//   - The GPU-restore-rejects-CPU-blob half of §7.3's cross-surface blob claim is a cell on the
//     GPU ABI's own suite (tests/t2112-gpu-1p0-red-suite), not this suite's obligation (design
//     Sec10 dim7: "named here as an obligation this design surfaces but does not itself build,
//     since it does not own gpu_1p0.h"). The CPU-restore-rejects-GPU-blob half IS this suite's

// --- Cell 1c (T-2233, closing finding O1 of the 1.2 release-candidate outside review,
// Claude/Poirot/4c8cd2d-superslm-1p2-release-candidate.md): the DAMPED-GREEDY decode path is
// held to a per-token allocation contract, through sslm_decode_step_v2.
//
// WHY THIS CELL EXISTS. Cell 1a reaches the contract through sslm_decode_step -- the legacy
// wrapper, which hard-codes mode = SSLM_DECODE_MODE_GREEDY -- so the damped path inherited the
// contract by construction without inheriting the cell that proves it. That gap is how a
// per-token, full-vocabulary allocation (a std::vector<int32_t> of vocab_size, 607,744 bytes at
// the shipped target vocabulary, plus a partial_sort over the whole row, once per emitted token
// per sequence) reached a release candidate with every cell in this file green. The remedy
// carries the selector's index and score scratch in the caller's workspace
// (sslm_decode_stepImpl's damped_indices/wide_logits, src/sslm_abi.cpp), and this cell pins it.
//
// WHAT THE ORACLE IS, AND WHY IT IS A SIZE RATHER THAN A COUNT. The first version of this cell
// asserted that a damped step allocates exactly as many times as a greedy step. It fails on the
// shipped release at delta=9, and the 9 are legitimate: AntiLmUpdate grows the sequence's own
// n-gram count tables as new contexts appear -- persistent STATE whose cost saturates as
// contexts repeat, disclosed in docs/api.md as the one damped-specific memory cost, and not the
// per-token scratch this contract governs. A count is the wrong instrument for the defect class
// anyway: the allocation that shipped was ONE call, indistinguishable by count from one hash
// node, and expensive only because of its SIZE.
//
// So the oracle counts VOCABULARY-SCALE allocations -- those at or above one int32 per
// vocabulary entry -- and requires the damped arm to make exactly as many as the greedy arm.
// The greedy arm is the reference rather than a constant, and it has to be: the engine itself
// allocates one vocabulary-sized logit buffer per token on BOTH paths, measured, so "no
// vocabulary-sized allocation on the damped path" is a bound neither arm can meet and would be
// a gate that fails on correct code. "No vocabulary-sized allocation the greedy path does not
// also make" is the claim the contract actually supports, it refuses the exact construction C1
// found -- a second vocabulary-sized buffer, on the damped path only -- and it is immune to the
// anti-LM's small-node churn at any count.
//
// THE WARM-UP PRECONDITION IS `anti_lm_max_order` STEPS, NOT A FIXED ONE (T-2312-REVISED,
// D-SLM4787). sslm_decode_stepImpl creates the sequence's own AntiLmState on its first damped
// call, and that state's own per-order outer tables (src/detail/context_hash.h,
// GrowableContextMap) allocate LAZILY (fold round 27, D-SLM4779) -- not at construction, but on
// each order's own first reachable AntiLmUpdate call. Order k's context has length k-1
// (src/damped_greedy_antilm.cpp, AntiLmUpdate/AntiLmPenalize: `ctx_len = order - 1`), and a
// context of length k-1 first becomes reachable once the sequence's own history holds k-1
// tokens -- which happens immediately before the k-th AntiLmUpdate call, since history_ grows
// by exactly one token per decode_step_v2 call in damped mode (one AntiLmUpdate per call,
// src/sslm_abi.cpp). So order k's own outer table allocates for the first time on the k-th
// warm-up call, and the highest order, `anti_lm_max_order`, needs `anti_lm_max_order` warm-up
// calls -- not one -- before every order's own one-time allocation is safely behind the
// measured window. A fixed one-step warm-up only ever covered the case anti_lm_max_order<=1;
// at the shipped default (anti_lm_max_order=2, SSLM_DAMPED_GREEDY_DEFAULT_ANTI_LM_ORDER), order
// 2's own outer-table allocation (BucketCountFor(8)=16 slots, the class default hint, 1,408
// bytes at this ABI's own Slot size) landed inside the SECOND decode_step_v2 call -- the one
// this cell was measuring -- and was large enough to cross this cell's own vocabulary-scale
// threshold at the small synthetic fixtures this suite runs on, producing a false vocabulary-
// scale-allocation finding against otherwise-correct code
// (Claude/Brunel/t2311-fold27-build-2026-08-27.md Sec12). The fix below reads
// `anti_lm_max_order` back from the params this cell itself initialized (never hardcoded) and
// warms up that many calls on both arms before opening the measured window, so this
// precondition tracks whatever `SSLM_DAMPED_GREEDY_DEFAULT_ANTI_LM_ORDER` (or an explicit
// override) actually is, rather than a number frozen at this cell's own authoring. No shipped
// header (include/superslm/sslm_abi.h, include/superslm/sslm_damped_greedy.h) discloses this
// per-order first-touch-allocation timing as a public contract (checked, T-2312) -- this is a
