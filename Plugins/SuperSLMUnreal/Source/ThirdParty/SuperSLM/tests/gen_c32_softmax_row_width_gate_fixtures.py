"""Generates sslm_c32_softmax_row_width_gate_fixtures.h -- witnesses for the
three C32 softmax-row width-gate defects confirmed by execution
(Claude/Popper/superslm-c32-softmax-denominator-2026-07-28.md) against the
green build at D:\\SuperSLM@1bf6638. `CheckSoftmaxRowWidthDomain` gates the
row on the closed-form proxy `M = q_b*q_b + q_c` (the i-exp value at the
shifted-max element) and returns `Ok` on every one of these triples, while
`SoftmaxRowQ15`'s int64 `total` genuinely overflows on the first witness.

WHAT THIS PINS, AND HOW. Every numeric truth that cannot be read off the
predicate's own int64 arithmetic (the row's REAL per-element i-exp values,
the exact-precision sum, and its two's-complement wrap to int64) is computed
by CALLING the vendored, hash-pinned reference
(tests/reference/superslm_spike/intmath.py's `i_exp_from_constants`, and
pipeline_prob_width_ceiling.py's `PROB_WIDTH_CEILING` -- the narrow
pipeline.py excerpt PROVENANCE.md already documents; the rest of pipeline.py
is deliberately never read here, matching gen_s3_3_red_regression_fixtures.py's
own established discipline) -- never re-implemented from either function's
formula in this module.

Re-running this script must reproduce this file byte-for-byte.
