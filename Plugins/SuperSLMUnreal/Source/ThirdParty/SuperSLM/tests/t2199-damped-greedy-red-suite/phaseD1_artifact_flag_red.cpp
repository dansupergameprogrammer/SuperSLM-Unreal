// T-2199 (Curie) -- Phase D1 red suite: the artifact flag + constants field (plan Sec8 D1,
// Decision A mechanism half, D-SLM3794) and Sec9 dim9's own siting of the pre-flag loader
// rejection cell here.
//
// REVISED 2026-08-20 (conductor's dispute-resolution commission, after brunel/t2199-phaseD@
// 5ced7a6 landed): TestD1a stays BORN GREEN, unaffected. TestD1b's fixture now writes a REAL
// DampedGreedyConstants section via the production MakeDampedGreedyConstantsSection (disputed
// 1 of 5 -- the fixture never wrote real bytes before; fixed, not worked around). TestD1c is
// RE-SCOPED (disputed 1 of 5, ruling below) -- its literal pre-build assertion is now
// definitionally false the moment D1 lands (flags=0x2 is KNOWN in this build), which is not a
// build defect, it is exactly what the cell's own original comment predicted. TestD1d is
// unchanged (not disputed, already GREEN).
//
// RULING on the TestD1b/TestD1c contradiction (conductor's dispute 1). Two readings were
// possible: (a) treat TestD1c as permanently broken and delete it, losing D-SLM3794's own
// "pre-damped-greedy runtime REJECTS a flagged artifact" guarantee as a live, re-checkable
// claim; or (b) re-scope TestD1c to what is STILL true and STILL checkable post-build --
// (b) is the correct reading: D-SLM3794's real, general promise is the FORMAT's own
// unknown-flag-bit-rejection mechanism (docs/sslm_format.md's Versioning section), not the
// specific historical fact that 0x2 itself was once unknown -- that fact is real, was true,
// and is preserved as dated evidence (below), but a cell asserting it AS A LIVE, RE-RUNNABLE
// CHECK is structurally impossible once the very build under test is the one that made 0x2
// known -- no bit choice fixes this (the builder's own evidence: picking a different literal
// for "the real flag" only moves the contradiction, since TestD1b's own fixture would then need
// the SAME new bit to be known, and TestD1c would need it to be unknown, in the identical
// build). TestD1c is renamed TestD1_UnknownFlagBit_RejectsWithBadHeader_FormatSemantics and now
// probes bit 31 / 0x80000000 -- docs/sslm_format.md's own PERMANENTLY RESERVED FOR TESTING bit
// (T-2199 fold 23's allocation table, added after this cell's own original 0x4 probe would
// have re-created the exact collision class fold 23 exists to close), pinning the GENERAL
// mechanism against the CURRENT, post-D1 loader -- an evergreen regression guard that can never
// collide with a future real allocation, not a time-scoped historical claim.
// The specific historical fact (0x2 rejected pre-D1) is preserved as a dated citation to this
// suite's own already-executed evidence (Claude/Curie/t2199-phaseD-red-2026-08-20.md's own
// "Born-green verification, isolated" section: checks=10 failures=0 against commit 2d7d381,
// before D1 landed) rather than reasserted as a cell that cannot both exist and pass.
//
// Coverage Model cells realized here (plan Sec9):
//   dim9  Persistence round-trip and version evolution -- GATE, D-SLM3719. The flag-gated
//         field itself loading/round-tripping -- TestD1a/TestD1b. The FORMAT's own general
//         unknown-bit-rejection mechanism -- TestD1_UnknownFlagBit_RejectsWithBadHeader_
//         FormatSemantics (re-scoped from the original TestD1c, see ruling above; the
//         ORIGINAL, time-scoped claim -- specifically that 0x2 was unknown pre-D1 -- is a
//         dated historical fact, cited above, not a live cell in a post-D1 tree).
