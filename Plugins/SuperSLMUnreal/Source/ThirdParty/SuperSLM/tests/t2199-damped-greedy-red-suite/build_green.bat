rem Stale-runlog guard (04e0d26 closing confirmation, finding 3): every runlog is deleted up
rem front, so a cell whose BUILD fails cannot contribute yesterday's numbers to the aggregate.

rem T-2199: builds every cell in this directory against the REAL Phase A/Phase C
rem implementation (src/damped_greedy_antilm.cpp, src/damped_greedy_topk.cpp -- and, for the
rem O2 mock cell alone, a TEST-ONLY substitute for the former, see below) alongside the same
rem certified sub-primitives build_link_red.bat compiles against, RUNS each resulting .exe,
rem and aggregates their own CHECK/FAIL/SKIP counters into ONE numeric total and one pass/fail
rem verdict.
rem
rem This is the missing half build_link_red.bat deliberately does not provide (S4): that
rem script's own job is proving the suite is RED (fails to link) before the implementation
rem exists; this script's job is proving the suite is GREEN (links and every check passes)
rem once it does. Neither script edits the other or the suite's own .cpp files -- this is
rem build glue, not a test.
rem
rem M7, `Claude/Poirot/927bbda-t2199-confirmation.md`: this script previously covered only the
rem four main cell files, iterating a fixed list, and declared (but never summed) its own
rem TOTAL_CHECKS/TOTAL_FAILURES/TOTAL_SKIPS -- "run the green battery" produced 254/0/2 while
rem the board recorded 264/0/2 (the O2 mock cell's own 10 checks, built and run only by the
rem separate build_o2_mock.bat, which nothing invoked). Fixed: this script now calls
rem build_o2_mock.bat as its own fifth cell and folds its exit code AND its own
rem checks=/failures=/skips= line into the SAME aggregate this script already computes for the
rem other four -- one recipe, one number, matching what the board cites.
rem
rem Usage: build_green.bat from this directory, or from anywhere (it cd's to its own
rem location first). Exit code 0 iff every cell linked clean AND every cell's own binary
rem reported zero failures; nonzero otherwise. Per-cell transcripts land in obj_green\ (the
rem four main cells) and obj_o2\ (the O2 mock cell, build_o2_mock.bat's own directory).
