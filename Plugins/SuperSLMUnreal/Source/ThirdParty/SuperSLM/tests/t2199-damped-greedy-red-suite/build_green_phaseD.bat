rem T-2199 Phase D (Brunel, build glue): builds every Phase D cell against the real
rem implementation (src/damped_greedy_phaseD.cpp, src/damped_greedy_phaseD_loop.cpp, plus the
rem widened src/sslm_abi.cpp/include/superslm/artifact.h) and runs each, mirroring
rem build_link_red_phaseD.bat's own source list plus the new production files. A real base
rem artifact is required for D2/D2a/D3's own product cells (--model=PATH); D1 needs none.
rem T-2899 (Curie, plan Sec3.5 step 1's own suite-wiring obligation): this script is now part
rem of the Stage 1 acceptance run, plan Claude/Plans/te266-gpu-path.md Sec3.5 step 3 -- make
rem the damped-greedy suite a required run, since CI does not run it. So it now also, first,
rem accepts an ADAPTER path as its second argument and forwards it as --adapter=PATH, which is
rem what TestD2_DampedGreedy_ComposesWithRuntimeAdapter, in phaseD2_wiring_red.cpp, needs to
rem run instead of SKIP -- the shopkeeper LoRA artifacts under D:/_artifacts/superslm-kits/SuperSLM-t2116-package/
rem artifacts/ are qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.sslm, the model, paired with
rem qwen2.5-1.5b-shopkeeper-lora-v2-t2102-runtime.sslm, the runtime-format adapter this base
rem model was built against, Claude/Brunel/t2116-crossvendor-package-2026-08-15.md Sec4. And,
rem second, it now fails the run on ANY skip, matching this project's own skip-fails-the-run
rem convention, T-2806 M2, tests/t2791-gpu-prefill-read-red-suite: a skip here means the
rem acceptance run did not actually exercise the adapter-composition cell, which is exactly the
rem gap this fold exists to close, so it is never silently accepted.
rem Usage: build_green_phaseD.bat [PATH-TO-.sslm] [PATH-TO-ADAPTER.sslm]
