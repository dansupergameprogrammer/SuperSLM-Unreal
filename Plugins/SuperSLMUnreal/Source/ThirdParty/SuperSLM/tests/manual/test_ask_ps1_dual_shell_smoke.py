"""Dual-shell smoke test for tools/ask.ps1 (T-1679).

Manual gate -- see tests/manual/README.md for why this directory is not
collected by CI: it needs the real multi-gigabyte model artifacts and both
Windows shells present on the same machine, neither of which the hosted
Linux runner has.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. `tools/ask.ps1`@`60e1198` fixed a defect that was invisible
under PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) and reproduced on every healthy run under Windows
PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`): the driver writes an informational
preflight line to stderr on every successful run, and the script used to
merge that stderr into its success stream with `2>&1` while
`$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` was in effect. Under 5.1 -- but not 7 -- a
native executable writing to stderr while `$ErrorActionPreference` is
`'Stop'` raises a terminating `NativeCommandError`, so a perfectly healthy
run looked like a crash on 5.1 only. The fix (already on `tools/ask.ps1`) is
to redirect stderr to its own temp file instead of merging it. No test
exercised the two shells before this ticket, so the defect shipped
unnoticed; this test runs the exact scenario -- a healthy `ask.ps1`
invocation, asked to run under both shells -- and would have caught it.

Each test function invokes `tools/ask.ps1` as a real subprocess under a real
shell binary and asserts: exit code 0, and the captured output shows a
completed run (a `wall_time_seconds:` line, which `ask.ps1` prints only after
the driver returns and the answer is decoded) with no
`NativeCommandError` -- the literal exception type the merged-stderr defect
raised. This is a coarse behavioral smoke check, not a content assertion on
what the model says; it is deliberately silent about the *quality* of the
answer, only that the pipeline ran to completion and exited clean.

PROOF THIS TEST CAN FAIL (StandardsDocument Sec4 -- a check shown able to
fail on a fault it exists to catch, not only shown to pass on unchanged
input). Reintroducing the merge (`2> $errFile` -> `2>&1`, dropping the
try/finally that raises `$ErrorActionPreference` around the call) into a
scratch copy of `tools/ask.ps1` and pointing `test_powershell_5_1` at that
scratch copy reproduces `NativeCommandError` and a nonzero exit under
`powershell.exe`, while the same scratch copy still passes under `pwsh` --
exactly the 5.1-only failure signature this test exists to catch. See the
build log for the transcript of that run; it is not reproduced as an
automated cell here because doing so would require shipping a second, bad
copy of the driver-invoking script in the tree, which is worse than the risk
it would guard against.
