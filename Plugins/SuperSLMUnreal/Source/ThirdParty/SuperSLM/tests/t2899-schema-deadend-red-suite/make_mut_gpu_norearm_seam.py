"""T-2916 (Curie), closing TE-370 M1: generates a GPU MUT_NOREARM variant of `gpu_1p0.cpp` FROM
THE LIVE TIP, replacing the out-of-repo `D:\\_t2900\\refs\\gpu_1p0_mut_norearm.cpp` (a static copy
of a since-superseded `gpu_1p0_v5.cpp` reference, predating the fault-injection seam
`make_mut_gpu_checkedreturn_seam.py` already regenerates the checked-return mutant against).

Same technique as that script (exact literal match, refuses unless exactly one occurrence),
applied to the sibling mutation Sec3.10.3 row 11 also names: the checked return to
`model->schemas.Transition(...)` stays intact (a genuine miss still yields `-2` at `SSLM_OK`),
but the `ready_for_logits` re-arm on that same miss is dropped -- the NEXT decode call then takes
the embed branch instead of the ready branch and drives a fresh forward, which must turn GPU
Cell 1's resumability assertion red while the FIRST dead-end call (Cell 1's own first assertion,
and Cell 2) stays green (`D:\\_t2900\\refs\\make_mut_norearm.py`'s own stated intent, reproduced
here against source that has not gone stale).

Usage: python make_mut_gpu_norearm_seam.py <path-to-gpu_1p0.cpp> <out-mutant.cpp>
