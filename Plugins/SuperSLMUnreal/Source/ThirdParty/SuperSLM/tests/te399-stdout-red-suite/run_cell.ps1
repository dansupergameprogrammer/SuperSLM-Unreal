# TE-402 S1 (Claude/Poirot/fcbc6a7-slm171-stdout-fix.md): "Stop" plus a bare `2>&1` on the exe made
# this script abort under Windows PowerShell 5.1 the moment the fixed `set` leg wrote its label to
# stderr -- 5.1 wraps each native stderr line from `2>&1` in a terminating NativeCommandError, so
# the script threw before reaching the exit-code grading below and a genuinely green suite read as
# a hard failure. `tools/t2116_crossvendor/run_crossvendor.ps1` already carries this exact hazard
# and sets `$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"` for it (see the comment above that assignment);
# matched here. `ForEach-Object { "$_" }` stringifies each captured record (native
# stdout/stderr line or ErrorRecord alike) before `Out-String` renders it, the same shape Poirot's
# own remedy probe (`Claude/Poirot/fcbc6a7-slm171-stdout-fix-probe/remedy_probe.ps1`) proved S3
# clean under both 5.1 and pwsh 7 with -- kept here for parity even though this script only grades
# by exit code, never by parsing $out, so a shell that mis-renders the label cannot mis-grade this
# suite the way it could S3's own regex.
