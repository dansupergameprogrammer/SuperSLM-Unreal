// T-2114 (fix round, Claude/Poirot/50f3d5d-t2113-1p0-gpu-core-build-review.md C1/O2): the two
// original cells' own bit-equality oracles used to be prose comments with no assertion under them
// -- the exact gap that let C1 (sslm_gpu_seq_save/_restore silently dropping hidden_codes) ship
// with a green suite. Both were rewritten to a REAL, executed, per-step comparison: an unbroken
// baseline sequence decoded straight through, against a save-mid-decode/restore-into-a-fresh-handle
// sequence decoded the same total distance, compared field-by-field
// (hidden_codes/hidden_scale/layer_index/kv_saturation_count/context_length -- the
// SequenceLayerState-complete surface C1 itself was about) after EVERY post-restore step, at
// SEVERAL different save points rather than one hardcoded layer_index. This also fixed a second,
// independent defect the rewrite surfaced by execution (StandardsDocument.md Sec5.4): the
// original cells called `sslm_decode_step_gpu` in a tight loop with no `sslm_gpu_ready` poll
// between calls, so every call past the first returned SSLM_BUSY (the async design submits and
// returns without fencing, design Sec4.3) -- the cells never actually reached their own claimed
// layer_index==8 scenario. `RunStepBlocking` below closes that.

// (TestDim9_N1_SmallCappedRestoreDerivesBlobOwnCap) now that sslm_gpu_seq_restore derives its

// the claim dim 9 was always supposed to prove and previously could not except via the expensive,
