/* sslm_gpu_1p0.h -- T-2112 red suite, promoted from the T-2111 strike probe.
 *
 * PROMOTION (T-2112, Curie, 2026-08-15): this file is the canonical copy of
 * Claude/Loki/t2111-probe/sslm_gpu_1p0.h (Wizard repo), moved here per the
 * T-2107 design's own Sec10 B9 / Sec11 dim 7 instruction -- "the probe
 * pattern ... promoted from a one-time strike instrument to a standing suite
 * fixture" -- so it is not left behind in the casebook (T-2112 brief). Every
 * .cpp/.c file in this suite directory and in interface_probe/ includes THIS
 * copy (via `#include "sslm_gpu_1p0.h"` with an -I to this directory), so
 * there is exactly one declared-surface header in the suite, never two
 * drifting copies. Regenerate this file (never hand-patch it out of sync)
 * whenever the design's Sec4/Sec5/Sec9 changes; interface_probe/'s own cells
 * are the check that a regeneration still compiles against every claim.
 *
 * Below this note is the T-2111 fold's own file, unchanged (verbatim
 * transcription of the T-2107 design of record's repaired public API surface,
 * Claude/Vitruvius/t2107-gpu-core-1p0-design-2026-08-14.md, Sec4/Sec5,
 * post-fold). Every declaration cites the design section it was copied from.
 * The pre-fold version lives in git history (this file's own history in
 * Claude/Loki/t2111-probe/, Wizard repo), not as a second file here, per this
 * project's append-only-in-git, current-truth-in-HEAD discipline
 * (StandardsDocument.md Sec6.6).
 *
 * The repair's single structural move, stated once rather than at every
 * declaration: every fallible call returns SslmGpuStatus; every value it
 * produces (a handle, a ready flag, a decoded status, a batch's per-sequence
 * outcomes) is delivered through an out-parameter, never through the return
 * value. This is the substrate's own established convention
 * (gpu_port.h:100, "status-returning at the entry point") -- see design Sec
 * 4.1.1 for the fold's own citation of that grounding.

/* T-2112 SUITE-INTEGRATION FIX (Curie, 2026-08-15), routed back as a finding rather than silently
 * carried: the T-2111 probe's own `typedef struct SslmModelView SslmModelView;` below declared a
 * SECOND, DISTINCT global-scope type of that name -- fine for the probe's own compile-only cells
 * (never built alongside the real engine headers), but genuinely AMBIGUOUS (MSVC C2872) the
 * moment a real fixture-loading translation unit includes both this header and
 * `superslm/model.h` (which defines the REAL `superslm::SslmModelView`) under `using namespace
 * superslm;` -- two distinct types sharing one name, not one type seen twice. This suite's own
 * product cells need the REAL type (to load a real .sslm artifact via `SslmModel::Load`), so this
 * header now forward-declares `SslmModelView` INSIDE `namespace superslm` and imports it with a
 * `using`-declaration -- the design's own intent (the 1.0 API's model/adapter-artifact parameter
 * IS the engine's own model view, never a second placeholder type) restated so it actually
 * compiles against the real engine. See Claude/Curie/t2112-1p0-red-suite-2026-08-15.md
 * (Wizard repo) Sec5 for the full finding, routed to the conductor for the design record's own
