// 37 §11 cells -- a pin on design Sec6.1's own build-decomposition claim, "re-derived against 24,
// not the stale 17"). Unlike every other file in this suite, this one links against the REAL,
// ALREADY-SHIPPED `PlanDispatchBudgetGpu` (include/superslm/gpu_port.h:474, defined
// src/gpu/superslm_gpu.cpp:2673) -- pure policy arithmetic, no device required, already built on
// main@495fbb4. Its own comment (gpu_port.h:467-469) states the CURRENT, PRE-B4 constant:
// `complete_layers = min(dispatch_budget / 17, ...)`. Design Sec6.1: the 1.0 build re-derives this
// against 24 (T-2105's own dispatches/layer count), not 17. This cell is RED BY ASSERTION, not
// red by link -- it compiles AND links today, and FAILS because the shipped constant is still 17.
// It goes green the moment design Sec10 B4 lands (the constant becomes 24), without needing any
// new symbol -- a real, minimal, already-executable regression pin for one piece of B4's own gate.
//
// GREEN as of T-2113 B4 (2026-08-15): `PlanDispatchBudgetGpu`'s own `kDispatchesPerLayer` moved
// 17 -> 24 in the same round the dispatch chain itself did (superslm_gpu.cpp) -- checks=2
// failures=0, confirmed by execution.
