// NOT the 0.5B model's, which is what the blob was actually saved at. The real 0.5B and 1.5B

// integer that makes `per_unit(0.5B) * context_cap` an exact multiple of `per_unit(1.5B)` by
// construction, so the blob's own workspace_size divides evenly against the TARGET model's
// dimensions and the size ladder admits it, reaching the hash check this cell actually exists to
// pin. `hidden_codes_size` also mismatches (0.5B's own hidden_size vs. 1.5B's, design's own
