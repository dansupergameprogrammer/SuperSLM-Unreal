// SuperSLM numeric-record trace instrument.
//
// The record schema is pinned field-for-field against a reference implementation's own chain
// and K/V-landing records; the reference's conformance contract is bit-equality on logits and
// trace, record-for-record, and this header is what makes that contract checkable in C++.
//
// This is a different instrument from the separate execution-shape profiling hook
// (`sslm_set_trace_hook`, carrying span identity and stats counters at kernel-phase
// boundaries): that hook carries execution-shape telemetry, while this one carries the numeric
// chain/landing records a reference trace produces. Neither this file nor any site it touches
// builds the profiling hook.
//
// Layer 1 holds no global state, and this instrument is no exception: the hook's state below is
// owned per model handle (SslmModelView::trace_hook, model.h) and threaded as an explicit
// parameter, never held in a process-wide static.
//
// Read-only by construction: installing a hook adds a notification after a site's own
// arithmetic has already produced its outputs. No hook call participates in, or can change, any
// value a site returns or writes — a forward pass with the hook installed produces digests
// identical to one without.
