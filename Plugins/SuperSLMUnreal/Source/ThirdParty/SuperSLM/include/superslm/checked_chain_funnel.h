// The single checked entry surface into the per-token dynamic-scale requant chain
// (intmath.h) at the composition's wide (int64) row width: RequantChainChecked and
// NarrowRowChecked are the only two functions in the forward pass permitted to call the
// underlying max-abs-reduction, scale-normalization, reciprocal, and requant primitives
// directly — every other site routes through one of these two, enforced structurally by a CI
// source check that bans those primitives from every other forward translation unit.
//
// Also declares the funnel's status vocabulary (SslmForwardStatus) and the domain predicates
// for runtime-derived operands that have no domain check of their own: the SwiGLU site's
// runtime gate scale, the bias-reconciliation site's operand pair, and the softmax row's
// numerator/sum width. CheckSoftmaxRowWidthDomain's own bound check runs at 128-bit width to
// avoid overflow when re-deriving it. This file also declares CheckPositionOverCap, a
// standalone predicate for the position-cap gate that forward_sites.h's RopeApplySite calls as
// its first act, before any rotary-table read.
//
// The RMSNorm site, the weight-scale fold-apply, the bias-reconciliation compute, and the
// embed entry are separate site-composition functions declared in
// include/superslm/forward_sites.h instead of here.

// far; `site_constant` is the artifact's KVC1 entry for this site. On Ok, `out_codes`

//
// `site` and `token_index` (§11 S3.1a; trace_hook.h) are the SslmChainTraceRecord
// fields this call cannot derive from its own arguments -- the caller names its
// site and the token it is processing. They default to an empty site and index 0
// so every existing call compiles unchanged; a caller that wants trace coverage
// passes its real site name and token index.
//
// `trace_hook_state` is the caller's own model
// handle's trace-hook state (SslmModelView::trace_hook, model.h) -- never a
// process-wide static. It defaults to nullptr so every existing call compiles
// unchanged and gets no tracing; a caller that wants trace coverage passes
// `&model_view.trace_hook`. Whenever `trace_hook_state` is non-null AND it
// carries an installed hook (SslmTraceHookInstalled), and only then,
// RequantChainChecked builds one SslmChainTraceRecord from the values it has
// already computed -- `wide_row`, `n`, the D'/Dn/s/R intermediates,
// `out_codes`, and the folded `*out_scale` -- and emits it through
// SslmEmitChainTrace on that same state, strictly after every write above.
// This block reads outputs already finalized above; it writes none of them, and
// it does not run at all when no hook is installed. That ordering is what makes
// installing the hook produce the identical ChainResult, out_codes, and
// *out_scale as not installing it (§10.3's instrumentation axis). Because the
// state lives on the model handle the caller passes in, two callers driving two
// different handles never observe or disturb each other's hook.
// The ONE door a site may use to obtain C19's reciprocal of a carried mantissa.
// §7.3's invariant is that no site re-derives the chain's
// own arithmetic, enforced by banning eight leaf names outside this file's own
// translation unit. That invariant was written when every site-level reciprocal
// was either artifact-carried (C27's landing takes `r_t` as a parameter) or
// internal to the funnel; C26's residual reconciliation (§6.2 step 8) is the
// first site that must derive one at runtime, from the STREAM's own mantissa,
// and so could satisfy neither form.
//
// This forwards to DynamicScaleReciprocal and does nothing else. It opens
// exactly ONE of the eight leaves, through a named and auditable door, rather
// than exempting a whole file: the other seven -- the max-abs reductions, the
// row bounds, NormalizeScale, both requant primitives and the int32 narrowing
// -- remain reachable only from inside this translation unit, which is the
// property that stops a site from reassembling the chain. Neither relocating
// the site into this TU nor allowlisting its call site preserves that property:
// the first converts a function-level rule into a file-level exemption, and the
// second removes the wall at one point permanently.
//
// **`DynamicScaleReciprocal`'s `(2^31, 2^32]` ceiling holds only for a canonical
// `Dn ∈ [2^30, 2^31)` -- the range `NormalizeScale` produces.**
// This door forwards to it on whatever mantissa the caller supplies, which is not
// required to be canonical (`CombineCarriedScale`'s own renormalization does not
// guarantee it). A caller reasoning about the reciprocal's maximum on a
// mid-composition operand must not assume `2^32`; treat the return value as an
// arbitrary `int64_t` and use a widened, checked composition downstream
// (`BiasReconcileWide`, `intmath.h`, is one such consumer) rather than a bound on

// C32's own derived-operand predicate (§7.2 second limb; §11 S3.3
// §6.2). The built C32 softmax row kernel (SoftmaxRowQ15, intmath.h) calls
// this before evaluating a row: `M = q_b*q_b + q_c` (the closed form,
// the row's own i-exp value at the shifted-max element) must satisfy
// `q_c >= 0`, `M <= kSoftmaxRowMaxSafeExponent` (the numerator), AND
// `width * M <= INT64_MAX` (the sum). `M` is formed and judged at 128-bit
// width (Poirot 2026-07-28 finding 1) rather than in int64, which is the
// exact re-derivation intmath.h:391-395 names as unsafe.
//
// **`q_c >= 0` (Popper 2026-07-28 Null 2, both bullets), and it is
// necessary but not sufficient.** With `q_c` non-negative, `M = q_b*q_b + q_c`
// can never be driven to zero or negative by a `q_c` that cancels against
// `q_b*q_b` -- the mechanism both witnesses in Null 2 use (`q_b=10, q_c=-100`
// gives `M=0` while a real row element reaches ~9x10^16 past the ceiling) --
// and it makes `m` provably non-negative before the sum check below runs, so
// the sum check's own `INT64_MAX / m` can never see a negative divisor (the
// signed-to-`size_t` cast Null 2's second bullet exploited). It is NOT
// sufficient on its own: `M` bounding every OTHER row element is a claim that
// holds only under the ratio `2*q_b >= q_ln2 - 1` (intmath.h:414), and this
// predicate has no `q_ln2` parameter with which to check that ratio (Popper
// Null 1) -- a `q_c >= 0` row can still be off that ratio. `SoftmaxRowQ15`
// (intmath.cpp) closes that remaining gap: it independently recomputes this
// same `M` from the call's own `q_b`/`q_c` and enforces it as a real
// per-element ceiling against the row's ACTUAL evaluated values, which this
// closed-form predicate cannot observe.
//
// The sum check runs after the `q_c >= 0` and ceiling tests, without
// overflowing itself, on the now-known-non-negative int64 `m`
// (`m == 0 || width <= static_cast<size_t>(INT64_MAX / m)`). Returns
// SoftmaxRowWidthOutOfDomain on any failure, Ok otherwise.
//
// **`width == 0` is rejected outright.** `ShiftByMax` (intmath.h) documents its own `n >= 1`
// precondition ("Undefined on an empty sequence (n >= 1)"), and
// `SoftmaxRowQ15`'s width-gated compute path calls it under that contract --
// so this gate, which exists to certify a width safe for that compute path,
// cannot answer Ok at a width the compute path is not defined for.
// (`SoftmaxRowQ15` also guards `width == 0` inside the kernel itself;
// this gate's rejection is independently required under
// reject-over-degrade and is unchanged by that guard.)

// C33's own position-cap guard (§11 S3.3's own gate line: "a position ==

// a host/runtime-supplied sequence position; `context_cap` is the artifact's
// own config field (model.h). Rejects when `position` is outside
// `[0, context_cap)` -- the cap is an EXCLUSIVE upper bound, matching the

// the cap is already one past the last valid slot). Declared here, in this

// can attach a red cell against a real, callable symbol rather than the bare
// `PositionOverCap` enumerator this tree carried with no function behind it.
// Wiring this into an actual forward call site is S3.3's own job, not S3.6's
// (this exact paragraph was found, a day after the ruling overturned it, still
// routing the wiring to S3.6, and is
// corrected here as part of the site's own build rather than as a separate
// pass): forward_sites.h's RopeApplySite calls this predicate first, before
// any ROP1 table read, exactly the ordering §11 S3.3's own gate line names.
