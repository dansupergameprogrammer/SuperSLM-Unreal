// SuperSLM integer-arithmetic kernels — Layer-1 requant primitives and the per-token
// dynamic-scale chain.
//
// This is a compiled C++ port of a pinned offline reference implementation. Every function
// here is a bit-for-bit reimplementation of that reference: conformance is output exactness
// against it over the whole domain, never a blessing of any particular decomposition. Standard
// library only; no float on any reproducible path — floats appear only as offline constants
// folded to integers by the converter, never here.
//
// The two families:
//   * Fixed-point requant primitives (`SaturatingRoundingDoublingHighMul`,
//     `RoundingDivideByPOT`) and their composition. Tie directions are pinned and opposite by
//     design: the doubling high-mul rounds toward +infinity, the divide-by-POT rounds away
//     from zero.
//   * The per-token dynamic quantizer: max-abs reduction, scale normalization, a fixed-point
//     reciprocal (corrected Newton), and the per-token requant composition (the "127 scale
//     wrapper").
//
// Cost determinism: every op count here is data-independent. The reciprocal runs exactly 3
// Newton iterations plus exactly 2 fixed-iteration-count correction steps; normalization runs
// one bit-scan plus one shift plus one unconditional select. No early exit, no data-dependent
// trip count.
//
// Wide intermediates: the reciprocal's Newton products and the requant composition's widest
// product (magnitude up to ~2^70) exceed int64. The port carries them in a portable 128-bit
// intermediate (no reliance on a compiler `__int128`, which MSVC lacks). Conformance is by
// output exactness against the pinned formula, not by the decomposition chosen.

// operation removes the question instead of answering it badly: the invalid call cannot be
// written.
//
// **Preconditions are now CHECKED rather than caller-ensured**, and the two are not the same
// promise. `q <= 0` (a positive q has no valid decomposition — beyond `q_ln2` it drives z
// negative) and `q_ln2 >= 1` (q_ln2 == 0 would divide by zero) were previously documented

// runtime (C30: the nonlinear consumers are same-scale ratios and it cancels).
//
// **The coefficients are NOT constrained to be positive.** C7 N2-5's positivity is a property of
// how C30 and the offline derivation produce these constants, not an invariant of this primitive
// — the parameter types admit all of `int64_t`, and `q_b` near `INT64_MIN` was an executed
// overflow (F21). `q_b` is therefore checked for *representability* of `q_p + q_b`, not for sign.
//
// **What changed for callers that were outside the contract (S-HARDEN-0, measured).** Two input
// strips executed no undefined behaviour before this slot and produced values, by accident rather
// than by promise: `0 < q < q_ln2`, where `(−q)/q_ln2` truncates to `z == 0`; and `q_ln2 <= −1`,
// where the clip bound goes positive and `z` lands on `I_EXP_CLIP_N`. Both are now refused. The
// preserved property is the one this design actually states — **behaviour-preserving INSIDE the
// domain** — and inside the domain every value is bit-identical, including the wrapped results of
// `kNotRepresentable`. Outside it, a documented precondition that a release build silently
// tolerated is now enforced; nothing depended on the tolerance.

// C7/C8 — the i-exp decomposition, as ONE checked construction/evaluation entry point
// (S-HARDEN-0; findings F9 and F21). Every consumer of the decomposition routes through
// here: the evaluator `IExpEvaluate` and the predicate `IExpConstantsInDomain` are both
// defined in terms of it, so neither can form the decomposition before the checks that
// make it safe have run.
//
// **Why a funnel rather than two accessors plus a documented rule.** The prior API exposed
// `IExpShift`/`IExpBase` so a caller could evaluate the domain instead of re-deriving it,
// and both projected through the clip/divide unguarded. Two orderings then went wrong the
// same way: the evaluator called them BEFORE asserting the domain, so the guard added to
// prevent `−I_EXP_CLIP_N · q_ln2` from overflowing ran after the overflow (F9); and the
// predicate itself formed `q_p + q_b` on a `q_b` that carries no lower bound, so the guard
// callers were told to invoke was undefined on the input class it exists to screen (F21).
// A rule about call order is a rule someone must remember; a funnel is a path that does not
// exist. `StandardsDocument` §4: where a rule can be made structural, make it structural.
//
// **`IExpConstruct` is TOTAL.** It is defined on all four `int64_t` arguments, asserts
// nothing about its own domain, and executes no undefined behaviour on any input — including

// reachable origins are a default-constructed `{0, 0, 0}` (safe: `z = 0` is a legal shift) and a
// construction this header validated.
//
// **The exact reach of that claim, stated narrowly on purpose.** It covers every route the
// language offers through the type system — aggregate initialisation, direct field assignment,
// derived types, copy and assignment, value-initialisation. It does **not** cover deliberate
// object-representation punning: `std::bit_cast` or `memcpy` over these three `int64_t`s can
// fabricate any `z`, and `IExpEvaluate` would then shift by it. That is out of contract and is
// not defended against, because nothing at this layer can defend against it. The claim is
// "cannot be written by accident", never "cannot be forged".
//
// **`q_c` is carried rather than passed to the evaluator, and that is not tidiness.** A separate
// `q_c` argument on `IExpEvaluate` would let a caller validate against one constant and evaluate
// against another, silently voiding the representability guarantee — a second derivation of one
// domain, which is the drift finding F10 already recorded happening between the S2.6 design and
// this predicate. Carrying it makes the mismatch unrepresentable.

// decomposition is sound and only the narrowing overflows, which is a defined (if wrong)
// result the evaluator still returns, so the caller that wants it needs `z` and `base`.

//
// **TOTAL, and it needs no preconditions of its own.** Every `IExpConstruction` that can exist
// holds a `z` in `[0, I_EXP_CLIP_N]` and a `base` this header formed without overflow, so there is
// no input to this function that is out of contract. That is the whole reason the operation is
// split: the check happens where the caller can act on it, and the arithmetic happens where
// nothing can be wrong.
//
// Evaluating a construction from a `kNotRepresentable` outcome is **legal and defined**: the low 64
// bits are kept and the result can be NEGATIVE. That is the exact value the pre-S-HARDEN-0 code
// returned for the same constants and a committed golden pins it. A caller that does not
// want it was told so by the outcome.
int64_t IExpEvaluate(const IExpConstruction& c);

// C7/C8 — **the domain predicate, for a caller that wants the yes/no and not the
// construction.** Returns whether `(base² + q_c) >> z` — the value `IExpEvaluate` produces —
// is representable in `int64_t`. A caller that is going to evaluate anyway should call
// `IExpConstruct` and read the outcome instead; this asks the same question and throws the
// construction away.
//
// **Why this exists as a function rather than a documented inequality.** Every other
// precondition this header states is a LOWER bound; there was no upper bound on `q_b` or
// `q_c`, and the evaluator narrows its 128-bit intermediate with an unchecked shift. A blind
// adversary strike produced contract-legal constants (`q = 0`, `q_ln2 = 887904998`,
// `q_b = 1733160715`, `q_c = 2^63−1`) for which the value is a NEGATIVE exponential:
// `base² + q_c` exceeds `INT64_MAX` and the low 64 bits are kept. With `q = 0` the shift is
// 0, so nothing shifts the overflow away.
//
// The test is performed in the 128-bit domain internally **because a caller cannot safely
// perform it**: the obvious check, `base² + q_c <= INT64_MAX`, squares `base` in int64 and
// itself overflows once `q_b` exceeds ~3.04e9 — reproducing the defect in the guard
// (the same overflow class this predicate exists to close). Callers therefore use this predicate; they do not re-derive it.
//
// **This predicate is TOTAL (S-HARDEN-0, F21).** It is exactly
// `IExpConstruct(q, q_ln2, q_b, q_c, nullptr) == IExpDomain::kOk`, so it validates `q`,
// `q_ln2`, and `q_b`'s range itself rather than inheriting them as caller-ensures
// preconditions, and it executes no undefined behaviour on any `int64_t` input. It
// previously asserted `q <= 0 && q_ln2 >= 1` and formed `q_p + q_b` unguarded, which made
// the guard undefined on `q_b = INT64_MIN` — the input class it exists to screen. Its
// **Its answer is unchanged INSIDE the contract, and changed on two strips outside it** —
// `0 < q < q_ln2` and `q_ln2 <= -1`, where the old predicate answered `true` without executing
// undefined behaviour and this one answers `false`. Those are the same two strips §157 records;
// stating "unchanged wherever the old predicate was defined" here would contradict that, and did.
// Use `IExpConstruct` directly when the reason for a rejection matters.
//
// **Cost note — read the condition, it is load-bearing.** `base = q_p + q_b`
// varies with `q` even at a fixed `z`, so this predicate is **not** `q`-invariant in
// general: at `q_ln2 = 4000000000, q_b = 1, q_c = 0`, `q = 0` answers `true` while
// `q = −3999999999` — same triple, same `z = 0` — answers `false`.
//
// The one-call-per-triple shortcut holds **iff `2·q_b >= q_ln2 − 1`.** `q_p` ranges over
// `(−q_ln2, 0]`, so `|base| = |q_p + q_b|` peaks at one of the two ends: `q_b` at `q_p = 0`,
// or `q_ln2 − 1 − q_b` at `q_p = −(q_ln2 − 1)`. The first dominates exactly under that
// inequality, and it is also the element where the bound `2^63·2^z − 1` is tightest (`z = 0`
// there), so largest numerator and tightest bound coincide and one `q = 0` call discharges
// the row. C30's derivation satisfies it comfortably — it fixes `q_b / q_ln2` at ≈1.952 —
// so a C30-fed caller always gets the shortcut. This is not a per-element runtime guard.
//
// **A caller whose constants fail `2·q_b >= q_ln2 − 1` must check BOTH ends** — `q_p = 0`
// and `q_p = −(q_ln2 − 1)` — or simply call this per element. Checking only the far end is a
// false all-clear: at `q_ln2 = 3e9, q_b = 1.8e9, q_c = 7783372039254775806` the element at
// `q_p = −(q_ln2 − 1)` answers `true` while `q_p = 0` answers `false`, and `q_p = 0` is the
// one that makes the parent return a wrapped negative under `NDEBUG`.

// for this kernel -- IExpConstruct can still answer kBadQ, kBadQLn2, or
// kBadQB for an accepted (q_b, q_c) pair (150 reachable (m, e) points
// degenerate to q_ln2 == 0, the coarse-scale underflow tail). The prior body
// discarded IExpConstruct's own [[nodiscard]] outcome ((void)IExpConstruct)
// and evaluated the untouched default construction anyway, silently
// emitting an all-zero probability row where the reference raises. This
// function now reads that outcome per element: a kBad* element contributes
// 0 to exps/total (the reference's own raise has no well-defined numeric
// substitute here, so the row's other elements are still computed) and the
// return value is false. kOk and kNotRepresentable are both well-formed
// decompositions (this header's own IExpConstruct doc: "*out is filled ...
// for kOk and for kNotRepresentable alike") and are evaluated exactly as
// before. **`[[nodiscard]]`, matching this header's own stated doctrine**
// (IExpConstruct's own declaration above: "load-bearing, not decoration.
// Without it the outcome can be dropped and the untouched `*out` read
// anyway"). The same shape applies here one level up: a caller who drops
// this return value gets a plausible-looking `out_probs` row with no
// diagnostic that its own inputs were rejected. A caller that genuinely
// does not need to know whether a row's constants were trustworthy discards
// the outcome explicitly, `(void)SoftmaxRowQ15(...)`, rather than silently.
//
// **Also enforces the row's real per-element peak against `M = q_b*q_b + q_c`
// (Popper 2026-07-28 Null 1, fixed here rather than only at the gate).**
// `CheckSoftmaxRowWidthDomain`'s own contract states `M` bounds every row
// element only under the ratio `2*q_b >= q_ln2 - 1`, and that predicate has
// no `q_ln2` parameter with which to check it -- so a `q_c >= 0`, in-ceiling
// `M` the gate accepts can still be an unsound stand-in for a row that is off
// that ratio (the gate cannot observe this; only the row's own evaluated
// values can). This kernel recomputes `M` from its own `q_b`/`q_c` arguments,
// at the same 128-bit width the gate uses, and treats any element whose real
// evaluated value falls outside `[0, M]` as untrustworthy exactly like a
// kBad* construction -- it contributes 0 to `total` and the return value is
// false. A row whose closed-form `M` is not itself usable (not representable
// in int64_t, `<= 0`, or exceeding `kSoftmaxRowMaxSafeExponent`) makes every
// element of that row untrustworthy, since there is then no bound left to
// check against. **The third condition is enforced by this kernel itself**
// (plan Sec14.1), not merely relied upon from the gate, so the
// `exps[k] << kProbFracBits` numerator shift below cannot overflow
// UNCONDITIONALLY -- for any element this kernel keeps, `M <=
// kSoftmaxRowMaxSafeExponent` gives `exps[k] << kProbFracBits <= 2^47 << 15
// == 2^62`, safely inside `int64_t`, whether or not the caller invoked
// `CheckSoftmaxRowWidthDomain` first. `total`'s width/sum bound is a
// separate claim and remains conditional: it is provably bounded only when
// the caller followed the documented contract (gate before kernel) -- the
// gate's own sum check proves `width * M <= INT64_MAX` for the same `M`, so
// `total` cannot overflow `int64_t` under that contract. A caller that skips
// the gate and calls this kernel directly still gets the per-element bound
// (enforced unconditionally, above), but not the width bound -- `total` can
// still overflow on an ungated, sufficiently wide row: this kernel guards
// `width == 0` (above) but performs no width upper-bound check of its own.
