// The converter proof manifest and its independent checks.
//
// The Python converter's writer discharges its "must load Ok" contract by invoking this
// project's own C++ loader (SslmModel::Load), not by asserting it. This header is that
// independent check: it re-derives facts about an already-loaded artifact (config-vs-tensor
// geometry, per-tensor extrema and saturation, section and artifact hashes) from the artifact's
// own bytes, never from the Python writer's intermediate arrays. `tools/sslm_verify.cpp` is the
// CLI that drives this into a JSON manifest; the functions here are the independently
// unit-tested core, so the geometry cross-check is provable without shelling out to Python.
//
// The config-geometry-vs-tensor-shape relation this file checks is also wired directly into
// SslmModel::Load (via ValidateConfigGeometryJoin, model.cpp), so a loaded artifact is rejected
// at load time if the two disagree; the functions here remain the independently unit-tested
// core, and the loader wraps them rather than re-deriving the arithmetic.

	// BuildProofManifestJsonImpl (src/proof_manifest.cpp) re-parses its config via the SAME
	// ParseConfig/ParseConfigImpl whose BadConfigDim check rejects any zero dimension first; a
	// zero-dimension artifact makes it emit `"config_geometry": null`, never a Zero* status.
	// tools/sslm_verify.cpp's own independent cross-check re-parses through the identical gate, and
	// ValidateConfigGeometryJoin (src/model.cpp, the third and only other real caller, reached only
	// from SslmModel::Load) is gated the same way upstream. All three of this enum's real C++
	// callers are therefore gated ahead of CheckConfigGeometry, and these two branches are
	// UNREACHABLE dead code from any live C++ caller. They are kept, additive-only (D-SLM3526), as
	// defense-in-depth on the pure function -- correct in isolation, but no test exercises them
	// through a production C++ path, and none can until a caller is built that genuinely skips
	// ParseConfig. tools/sslm_convert_validate.py's `check_config_geometry` is the one surface that
