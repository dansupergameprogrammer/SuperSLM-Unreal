// The clamp comparison the caller's own `clamp(..., -127, 127)` performs is
// evaluated once, internally, against this function's own about-to-be-
// returned raw value -- not a second, independently-derived comparison.
// **Neither e_t nor e_a carries a domain check anywhere in this tree**:
// an extreme composed exponent drives the negative-k
// branch's left shift past the 128-bit carry's own width, which would
// otherwise narrow to a silently wrong small `raw` with the counter never
// told. This function detects that loss internally (shift-then-verify) and
// counts it as a clamp event even when the narrowed `raw` itself does not
// look out of range -- the return value stays exactly as unreliable in that
// class as it always was (caller-ensures: neither e_t nor e_a is domain-
// checked here), but the counter is not fooled by it.
//
// The composed exponent `62 - (e_a - e_t)` ITSELF is computed without
// signed-integer-overflow UB regardless of `e_a`/`e_t`'s values (closing
// the finding above): both subtractions use unsigned-
// wraparound overflow detection and saturate to `INT64_MIN`/`INT64_MAX`
// rather than overflow, and the result is clamped to a small magnitude
// before either branch below narrows it to `int` for a shift amount --
// closing a second, silent-truncation hazard the same extreme composed
// exponent reaches (an unclamped magnitude narrowed straight to `int`
// lands on an arbitrary small value, not one that reads as "past the
// 128-bit width"). This is UNDEFINEDNESS safety, not a domain check: the
// return value is exactly as unreliable, for the same reason stated above,
// as it always was. Whenever the
// return value itself IS out of `[-127, 127]`, or this internal detection
// fires, `*out_saturation_count` is INCREMENTED by exactly one (never reset,
// never assigned): the accumulator
// is the CALLER's, owned across every call for one sequence (§8.2:
// "granularity: per sequence"; reset on sequence create / `sslm_seq_reset` is
// the caller's own responsibility, not this function's). This has NO EFFECT
// WHATSOEVER on the return value (§8.2's own non-negotiable property) --
// the raw, unclamped result is identical whether or not counting is
// requested. Defaults to `nullptr`, in which case nothing is read or
// written, exactly the convention `RmsNormSite`/`EmbedEntry` already use for
// their own optional trailing parameters -- every existing call (there are
// none yet) compiles unchanged. The REPORTING surface -- a field on the
// decode-step status that exposes this accumulator to the host -- is a
// separate, deferred obligation (S3.6/S3.7's own decode-step struct; see
// this pass's build log) and is NOT this parameter's job: this parameter is
// the counting mechanism only, never a report.
//
// `out_magnitude_exceeded_int64` (Sec7.2b, Sec14.14): a
// SECOND, DISTINCT out-parameter from `out_saturation_count` above -- the two
// conditions are not the same claim. `out_saturation_count`'s own internal OR
// (`magnitude_exceeds_clamp || raw < -127 || raw > 127`) is coupled to the
// K/V-landing caller's own `[-127, 127]` clamp range, which is not every
// caller's contract (`ResidualReconcileSite` below composes no clamp at all,
// Sec6.2 step 8). This parameter reports only "the true, pre-narrowing
// magnitude does not fit `int64`" -- in the non-negative-`k` branch, the
// 128-bit quotient exceeds `INT64_MAX` (Sec7.2b: "the divisor 2^(k+1) ... must
// bring that magnitude below 2^63" is this exact threshold, stated there as
// the reachability bound and enforced here as the check); in the negative-`k`
// branch, the left-shifted 128-bit magnitude either loses bits (the
// shift-then-verify mismatch already computed for the existing counter) or
// itself exceeds `INT64_MAX`. Neither branch's condition is the `> 127`
// clamp-range test the existing counter also performs -- a wide row
// legitimately carries values outside `+/-127` at this site, so that test
// would false-positive on every ordinary large-but-correct result. When
// non-null, written exactly once per call (never OR'd with a prior value,

//
// `hidden_codes` is caller-owned, `hidden_size` elements: the residual
// stream's own int8 codes. `hidden_scale` is the residual's own carried
// (m, e). `layer_index` is the layer-position marker -- the next layer
// RunLayerLoop resumes at, `0 <= layer_index <= num_hidden_layers`.
// `layer_index == num_hidden_layers` means the current token is complete;
// starting a fresh token resets it to 0 (§9.3: "a sequence resting between
// whole tokens carries a marker at layer 0 and a zero-length residual" --
// realized here as `layer_index == 0`, `hidden_codes` not yet meaningful).
//
// §13 dim 9 pins this struct as "addressable as a unit", an
// explicit invitation for a caller to save and restore one -- which means a
// value received in any of these five fields, by EITHER of the two
// functions below that take a `SequenceLayerState&`, carries no guarantee
// of having come from either loop's own resume path. The closed unit is
// the cross product of the two functions and the five fields, not the five
// fields against one function:
//
//   - `RunLayerLoop`: its own top-of-function guard block enumerates all
//     five fields directly; see it for what is validated, what is not, and
//     why in each case. `hidden_codes == nullptr` and `context_length < 0`
//     are rejected there. `layer_index` is already fully bounded by the
//     guard immediately following it. `kv_saturation_count` and
//     `hidden_scale` need no guard -- neither is ever read back as a size,
//     offset, or index.
//   - `RunGreedyDecodeLoop`: its own RunWholeToken step overwrites
//     `hidden_scale` and `layer_index` with fresh, non-restored values
//     BEFORE its first call into `RunLayerLoop` -- so a restored value in
//     either field is discarded, unread, on this path. That same step
//     writes THROUGH `hidden_codes`, dereferencing the caller's own
//     (not-yet-overwritten) pointer one call frame BEFORE `RunLayerLoop` is
//     ever entered. `context_length` and `kv_saturation_count` are never
//     touched directly by this function; both reach `RunLayerLoop`'s own
//     guard block above still carrying whatever value the caller restored.
//     So of the five fields, `hidden_codes` is the only one read, unguarded,
//     before `RunLayerLoop`'s own guard block runs -- `RunGreedyDecodeLoop`
//     therefore carries its own `hidden_codes == nullptr` guard
//     (forward_sites.cpp), checked immediately after its `kv_precision`
//     check and before any token is embedded: the one cell of the ten (two
//     functions x five fields) that needs a guard outside `RunLayerLoop`'s

// gate/up projections -> MlpActSite -> down_proj -> mlp_residual
// (ResidualReconcileSite) -> the resume-point update (`seq.layer_index += 1`
// per completed layer).
//
// Two contracts decided at §9.3, not invented here:
//   - `layer_budget == 0` is `InvalidLayerBudget`, and `seq` is left
//     bit-identical to its pre-call state -- `hidden_codes`, `hidden_scale`,
//     AND `layer_index` are all untouched. A step that consumes a call,
//     advances nothing, and returns "pending" is a host-visible livelock
//     (§11's reject-over-silently-degrade law).
//   - There is no `all` sentinel. "Every layer" is spelled
//     `layer_budget == num_hidden_layers`.
//
// `context_cap < 1` is `InvalidContextCap`, checked before the workspace size
// is computed from it -- `context_cap` sizes the required K/V workspace
// (`num_hidden_layers * context_cap * num_key_value_heads * head_dim * 2`),
// and every value outside `[1, INT64_MAX]` (zero or negative) is invalid for
// the same reason: neither is a legitimate count of cache positions. One
// check covers both, because both violate the identical domain requirement.
//
// A layer commits atomically. Every checked call between `attn_norm` and
// `mlp_residual` (inclusive) can reject; on ANY rejection inside a layer,
// `seq` is left exactly as it was before that layer's attempt started --
// `hidden_codes`, `hidden_scale`, AND `layer_index` all untouched, the same
// property the `layer_budget == 0` cell already requires one level up. §9.3
// states the resume point is a layer boundary and nowhere else, so no
// intermediate, mid-layer state may ever become visible in `seq`; a rejection
// therefore leaves the sequence ready to re-attempt the WHOLE layer, never a
// partially-applied one.
//
// The residual (`seq.hidden_codes`/`hidden_scale`) lives in `seq`'s OWN
// state, never in `workspace` -- poison-filling `workspace` between two
// calls that together advance the SAME sequence across a layer boundary must
// not change the final output (master plan §8.2/W1; this sub-slot's own red
// cell).
//
// This function performs NO WGT1/KVC1-by-name resolution (see LayerWeights'
// own header comment) and reads `context_cap`-worth of K/V state through
// S3.7's own `KeyRow`/`ValueRow` accessors, declared just below -- every
// position 0..context_cap-1 is reachable, not only position 0.
//
// `layers` has `num_hidden_layers` entries. `rope_tables` is the loaded ROP1
// view, shared across every layer (ROP1 is model-wide, never per-layer).
// `site_prefix`/`token_index`/`trace_hook_state` are forwarded into every
// internal funnel call, with each site's own per-layer name appended (e.g.
// `"layer0.attn_norm"`) -- the same convention RmsNormSite's own doc
// comment states, extended across the whole loop.
//
// S3.7 (§11 S3.7 "Fail fast on a full cache"): on EVERY call, when
// `seq.context_length >= context_cap`, this returns `KvCapacityExhausted`
// before any layer runs, `seq` left bit-identical -- "defined and resumable"
// (the status enum's own comment): the sequence is left valid and
// query-able, and a second call at the SAME state rejects the identical way
// rather than corrupting the handle. Checked without regard to
// `seq.layer_index`: a caller-restored `seq` (§13 dim 9 pins the struct as
// addressable as a unit, for exactly this save/restore use) is not bound to
// have come from this loop's own resume path, so a full cache at a non-zero
// `layer_index` is rejected here rather than reaching the landing write
// (Poirot 0d64462 review, Critical 1). S3a builds no eviction or truncation
// remedy for a full cache; that stays S4's.
// T-2432 (Track A step 2, design §6 Track A step 2/§2.1): `q_width` is Q's own real output
// width / O's own real input width (`num_attention_heads * head_dim`), independent of

// existing trailing-default parameter, so every one of this function's existing callers

// - Exactly-once check: each task index is admitted once, by compare-exchange on call-local state
//   (0 = not started, 1 = admitted, 2 = done), before it writes any row. A second invocation of an

// step, src/sslm_abi.cpp) or GPU (G5-5's parity bridge, src/gpu/gpu_1p0.cpp), calls this exact
// function on its own hidden-state-derived logits, never a parallel reimplementation --
// StandardsDocument.md Sec5.4's "one implementation, not two copies that could drift"
// discipline, applied here the same way an earlier pass already applied it to weight packing.
// Extracted from sslm_abi.cpp's own file-local ApplyMaskAndArgmaxImpl (G5-2) so a second TU
// (gpu_1p0.cpp) can call the identical bits rather than a lookalike -- bit-parity between the

// never in the sense of picking which page. Masked-out positions (bit not set) are forced to
// INT32_MIN so ArgmaxLowestIndexTieBreak's own lowest-index tie-break can never select them.
// NO defensive check for an all-masked page (design's own positive requirement, design Sec3/
// Sec7 dim11) -- an all-zero mask degrades to picking the lowest index, exactly dim11's own
// negative-control cell. Mutates `logits` in place; caller-ensures `vocab_size >= 1` (the same

// §9.1's two terminal reasons a greedy decode loop stops for a reason OTHER

// which names rejections; a loop that reaches either of these two reasons
// is not rejected, it is DONE, and §11 S3.6's own gate text ("terminates on
// each of the two stop conditions with a status naming which fired")
// requires the two to be distinguishable from each other and from Ok.
enum class SslmDecodeStopReason {
	MaxTokensReached = 0,  // the host's max-token count was reached with no stop id matched
	StopTokenMatched = 1,  // the produced token is a member of the host's stop-id set
};

// §9.1's greedy decode loop: "Prefill the prompt in one call; then repeat:
// one forward over the last token, argmax with C16's tie-break, append,
// until a stop condition." Prefills `prompt_tokens` (each embedded via
// EmbedEntry and run through RunLayerLoop with `layer_budget ==
// num_hidden_layers` -- §9.3's own "every layer" spelling, one WHOLE token
// per call; this loop's own scope is whole-token stepping, never the
// layer-range micro-step RunLayerLoop itself also supports), then repeats:
// embed the last produced (or last prompt) token, RunLayerLoop, RmsNormSite
// under site "final_norm" (its own carried scale discarded, §6.4 step 14),
// LogitsSite, ArgmaxLowestIndexTieBreak, append -- until a stop condition.
//
// Every host-supplied id -- EVERY element of `prompt_tokens` AND EVERY
// element of `stop_ids` -- is validated against `[0, vocab_size)` on the
// IDENTICAL rule EmbedEntry already applies to a single token (§9.1: "on the
// same rule as a host-supplied prompt token"): rejected with
// TokenIdOutOfRange. Every stop id is checked BEFORE the loop starts (a stop
// id the argmax can never produce is a silently-inert stop condition, never
// discovered by running the loop, §9.1's own reasoning) and every prompt id
// is checked as each is embedded, in encounter order, so a bad prompt id
// past a good prefix still leaves everything at and after it untouched.
// `stop_count == 0` is legal and means "run to `max_new_tokens`" (§9.1: "An
// empty set is legal"). The produced token is appended to `out_tokens`
// BEFORE the stop-id test runs (§9.1: "The produced token is appended before
// the stop test, so a stop token appears in the output sequence"), so a
// matched stop token is the LAST element of `out_tokens` on
// `SslmDecodeStopReason::StopTokenMatched`, never withheld.
//
// `out_logit_rows` (caller-owned, `out_tokens_capacity * vocab_size`
// elements) receives, at row i, the full int32 logit row LogitsSite computed
// immediately before the i-th produced token was selected -- the raw
// material for §10.1's final-logit digest (decode_digest.h); this function
// does not itself compute either digest (§10.2's exclusion table is a claim
// about what participates in the arithmetic and the hash alike, and keeping
// digesting a separate, pure function of the two output arrays this call
// already produces is what makes that claim checkable rather than asserted).
//
// On Ok, `*out_stop_reason` names which of the two conditions fired,
// `*out_tokens_produced` is the number of NEWLY produced tokens written to
// `out_tokens`/`out_logit_rows` (`prompt_tokens` is never echoed into
// `out_tokens`), and `seq` reflects the sequence's state after the last
// successfully produced token. On any rejection (a bad prompt id, a bad stop
// id, or any status RunLayerLoop/LogitsSite themselves can return),
// `out_tokens`, `out_logit_rows`, `*out_tokens_produced`, and
// `*out_stop_reason` are all left untouched, and `seq` is left in the state
// RunLayerLoop's OWN atomic-layer contract already guarantees (§11 S3.5: a
// rejected layer leaves `seq` exactly as it was before that layer's own
// attempt).
//
// `out_tokens`/`out_logit_rows` have `out_tokens_capacity` (rows, for the
// latter) elements. T-2243 review finding 6 (D-SLM4113): enforced, not
// caller-ensures -- mirrors the sibling `RunGreedyOrDampedGreedyDecodeLoop`'s
// own F3 fix (T-2237). The generation loop rejects with
// `OutputCapacityExceeded` before either output buffer is touched the moment
// the next produced token would not fit; `out_tokens_capacity >= max_new_tokens`
// no longer needs to hold for correctness, only for every token to be kept.
// This function performs no per-layer WGT1/KVC1-by-name resolution of its
// own (LayerWeights' own header comment); `embed_weights`/`head_weights` are
// the same kind of raw, caller-resolved pointer EmbedEntry/LogitsSite above
// already take.
//
// S3.7 (§14.4, §11 S3.7 "The int16 narrowing"): `kv_precision` is checked
// FIRST, before `seq`, `workspace`, or any output parameter is touched, and
// before any token is embedded -- `SslmKvPrecision::Int16` is a defined,
// load-legal CFG1 value (§14.4 is a declared quality narrowing, not a
// hostile-input rejection) rejected here with `KvPrecisionUnsupported`;
// `SslmKvPrecision::Int8` is unaffected and proceeds exactly as before this
// parameter existed. This parameter's own `= Int8`
// default is gone -- not because anything was found wrong with defaulting
// IT, but because C++ forbids a defaulted parameter from preceding a
// required one, and `option_g_fused_k_landing` (below) is made required by
// this same round. Every real call site already passes `kv_precision`
// explicitly (`tools/sslm_generate.cpp`, `tools/sslm_layer_trace.cpp`,
// `tests/test_main.cpp`'s `TestOptionGSelectionDispatch_EndToEndProductionPath`)
// except the two `tests/test_main.cpp` sites this round also makes explicit
// (`DecodeLoopCallFixture::Run`, `TestRunGreedyDecodeLoopRejectsInt16Kv
// PrecisionBeforeAnythingElse`'s positive control) -- this is a mechanical
// consequence, not a second independent decision.
// (design Sec31.2.1, round 4): trailing
// REQUIRED parameter -- no default. An earlier build round
// gave this a defaulted `= false`, following `kv_precision`'s own precedent
// so every existing call site would compile unchanged; a later
// confirmation found that precedent wrong for THIS parameter:
// a default here is silently-wrong-by-default rather than silently-inert,
// because a caller that omits it does not get legacy-forever (harmless) --
// it gets whatever `sslm_layer_trace.cpp` actually got, a SECOND consumer of
// this function that kept compiling, kept passing its own self-check (its
// production leg and its manual-replay leg both silently ran legacy
// together, so bit-for-bit agreement proved nothing about which mode either
// leg was in), and shipped a flags=1 trace indistinguishable from a flags=0
// one. StandardsDocument S4: where a rule can be made structural, make it
// structural -- removing the default turns "the next omitted caller" into a
// compile error instead of a second silent-agreement instrument, which a
// reviewer-named CI assertion over call sites (the alternative considered)
// would not: a text-scan checker is exactly the class of structural-absence
// check this same build round already had to hunt a blind spot out of
// (`check_no_optionG_fused_site_skip.py`, this ticket), where the compiler's
// own overload resolution has none. The caller (`tools/sslm_generate.cpp`,
// link 4, and now `tools/sslm_layer_trace.cpp`'s own production leg) passes
// `model_view.option_g_fused_k_landing` (link 1/2) explicitly, the same way
// it already passes `model_view.config.kv_precision` as this signature's own
// previous last argument. Threaded through to the `RunWholeToken` lambda's
// own `RunLayerLoop` call inside this function's definition (link 5,
// `forward_sites.cpp`), which selects the 16-parameter overload's
// `OptionGKLandingMode` explicitly.
// SSLM-GEOMETRY-SITE: GS-26
// T-2441 (Poirot 327ee29-t2438-ask5-tracka-review.md, Critical 1, D-SLM5431): this entry
// point's own signature carried `hidden_size`/`head_dim` but never `num_attention_heads`, so
// it had no way to supply T-2432's own `q_width` (`num_attention_heads * head_dim`) to the
// forward path it drives -- every caller silently fell through to `RunLayerLoop`'s own
// sentinel default (`q_width = 0`, "derive as hidden_size"), which is the pre-widening
// identity and is WRONG the moment a loaded artifact's real geometry is non-square (the
// R1 identity this whole ask exists to remove). `num_attention_heads` is a REQUIRED trailing
// parameter, no default -- matching this function's own established precedent one parameter
// to its left (`option_g_fused_k_landing`'s own header comment, above: "a default here is
// silently-wrong-by-default rather than silently-inert... removing the default turns the next
// omitted caller into a compile error instead of a second silent-agreement instrument"). Every
// existing caller (11 call sites across tests/tools) was updated in the same change; a future
// caller that omits this parameter fails to compile, not silently returns a wrong answer.
