// sslm_damped_greedy.h -- T-2199 Phase A (the n-gram anti-LM) and Phase C (the shared

//
// Transcribed from the design of record, Claude/Plans/superslm-1p2-fsd-plan-2026-08-19.md
// (Wizard repo) at commit 603f9bfdb3 -- Sec7 (the mechanism), Sec7.2 (the anti-LM, its own
// exact-key-lookup determinism argument and its normalized-mixing-weight [0, 2^15] clamp),
// Sec7.3 (the two numeric surfaces), Sec7.4 (top-k selection, corrected tie-break: mask
// status before index), Sec7.5 (score/combine, the INT64_MIN masked-score floor, the >>15
// Q15 rescale), Sec7.6 (final selection), and Sec8 Phase A/Phase C's own decomposition into
// A1/A2/C1/C2/C2a/C3. This is the production copy of the interface Curie's own red suite
// declares (tests/t2199-damped-greedy-red-suite/sslm_damped_greedy.h) -- signatures match
// exactly (that is what makes the suite link); this file's own comments are the
// implementation's, not a duplicate of the suite's citation trail.
//
// Scope boundary matching the build commission: Phase B (the vocab-row logit scale
// artifact/converter), Phase B0 (the empirical calibration instrument), Phase D (ABI
// surface, both decode entry points, the GPU bridge), and Phase E (the confirmatory
// acceptance run) are OUT of this header's scope -- `(q_ln2, q_b, q_c)` and `alpha_q15` are
// taken as plain function parameters here, never read from an `sslm_decode_params` this
// header does not touch.
//
// Fix round 2026-08-20 (Claude/Poirot/7be9508-t2199-phaseAC-review.md, FIX-THEN-SHIP):
// every function below is caller-ensures on its pointer parameters (`state`, `anti_lm`,
// `masked_row`, `mask_bits`, `out_*`) -- none is null-checked, matching this codebase's own
// established convention elsewhere in `src/`; a null pointer where a non-null one is
// documented is undefined behaviour, not a rejection. Two domains are now enforced by the
// functions themselves rather than left as unstated preconditions a caller could cross into
// undefined behaviour or a corrupted candidate set (Poirot C1/S5) -- see `AntiLmCreate` and
// `DampedGreedyScoreAndArgmax`/`Diag` below for the exact contracts. The general (alpha/n/k)
// rejection Phase D1 will site at the ABI boundary supersedes both once built.

// The 2026-08-20 calibration this comment previously carried ("~2.9x low" at max_order=3,

// UNCHANGED, re-run against the fold-round-27 built tree -- GrowableIntSet's never-shrink
// Grow() repair, GrowableContextMap's lazy construction, and order 1's own construction-site
// hint, all three landed -- T-2299's own method: global operator new accounting, base vs.
// new, over the real AntiLmCreate/AntiLmUpdate/AntiLmPenalize surface): the understatement is
// NOT a stable per-order ratio. It is workload-dependent -- a wider vocabulary spreads the
// same live-bucket cost over more distinct candidate tokens (shrinking the ratio); a longer
// generation at a fixed vocabulary saturates each context's own inner table further (growing
// it). Measured ranges, by max_order, sampled over vocab in {4096, 8192, 16384} and
// generation length in {20000, 50000} tokens (six cells, not exhaustive of the workload
// space; per-cell figures in Claude/Brunel/t2311-fold27-build-2026-08-27.md):

//   max_order=5: 1.98x-2.35x low
// These ranges supersede the pre-fold-27 figures this comment previously carried
// ("1.31x-2.61x"/"3.85x-4.98x"/"4.54x-5.60x", measured before fold round 26's own Grow()/
// ContextEntry::counts corrections landed and stale a second time by the time fold round 27

// Claude/Vitruvius/t2265-fold27-superslm-fp-free-open-2026-08-26.md Sec2, D-SLM4778). A
// caller pricing this instrument does NOT round using a single fixed multiplier -- these
// ranges were sampled at three vocab sizes and two generation lengths, and a workload outside
// that sample can shift the true ratio further in either direction. The only claim this
// reading supports unconditionally is its own name: a LOWER BOUND. A caller needing a number
// closer to its own true footprint re-runs Claude/Brunel/t2302-footprint-probe/'s method at
// its own actual vocab size and expected generation length, rather than applying an
// interpolated multiplier measured on a different workload.
//
// Deliberately EXCLUDES the per-sequence generated-token history (grows by one token per

// pricing the anti-LM's TOTAL footprint adds `generation_length_so_far * sizeof(int32_t)`
