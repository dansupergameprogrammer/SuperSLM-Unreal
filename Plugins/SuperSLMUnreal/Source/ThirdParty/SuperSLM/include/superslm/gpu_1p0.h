// SuperSLM GPU acceleration API (D3D12-backed) -- the public entry points for creating a GPU
// context; mapping a model and its LoRA adapters into device residency; creating, saving,
// restoring, and releasing per-sequence decode state; and running batched decode steps on the
// GPU.
//
// Every fallible call returns the scoped SslmGpuStatus enum and is noexcept; every value it
// produces (a handle, a ready
// flag, a decoded status, a batch's per-sequence outcome) is delivered through an out-parameter,
// never through the return value. Every function below is declared at global scope with
// ordinary C++ linkage -- not extern "C", not inside a namespace -- and a caller linking
// against this header's implementation must match that scope exactly.
//
// A per-sequence decode-time rejection (an out-of-domain input, a guard check failing on that
// sequence's own step) is reported as SslmGpuStatus::SSLM_SEQUENCE_REJECTED, kept distinct from
// SslmGpuStatus::SSLM_DEVICE_LOST: the device stays healthy and no other sequence in the same batch call is
// affected. sslm_gpu_seq_restore additionally rejects a restore blob whose recorded
// model-content hash does not match the target model handle
// (SslmGpuStatus::SSLM_RESTORE_MODEL_MISMATCH), so
// a sequence saved from one model cannot be silently replayed against a different one.

     * (a) an ordinary, healthy rejection -- most visibly, the batched G5 prefill entry points
     *     (SslmGpuSeqPrefillPromptForG5Bridge/SslmGpuSeqPrefillSchemaContentForG5Bridge, below)
     *     returning it when a chunk's own derived admit count comes back short of what was

     *     cap-boundary behavior, mirrored. The device and the context stay fully usable; a
     *     caller may continue issuing calls against the same context and sequence.
     * (b) a device fault, or a GPU operation that failed for a reason other than memory -- a
     *     lost/removed device, a missing shader, a D3D12 call failing with an HRESULT other than
     *     E_OUTOFMEMORY (an exception caught and contained at this boundary from the GPU
     *     command-submission tail among them). The command list is recovered at the point the
     *     fault is caught (confirmed Closed, matching the invariant every other failure path in
     *     the same function already restores) and the context stays usable for a caller that
     *     continues issuing calls against it, PROVIDED neither exception below applies -- both are
     *     checked and resolved to this same status before returning, so a caller cannot tell the
     *     difference from the status alone and must not assume recovery from it:
     *     - a confirmed device-removed condition (`GetDeviceRemovedReason()` non-S_OK) is
     *       genuinely terminal for the context regardless of the command-list state, and no call
     *       against it can be trusted afterward. At 1.6.0, a removed device stays this process's
     *       submission device, so every later sslm_gpu_context_create in the process returns
     *       SSLM_DEVICE_LOST until the process restarts (T-2845, D-SLM7386); a 1.6.x point
     *       release gives every context its own device instead of sharing the process's one, so
     *       a fresh device is built once every context on the removed one has been destroyed.
     *     - a stranded submission. A failed `Close()` -- whatever its HRESULT, E_OUTOFMEMORY
     *       included -- is retried once and then confirmed (`Reset()` then `Close()`: a list the
     *       driver already closed accepts the `Reset()`, one still recording refuses it). A list
     *       that cannot be confirmed Closed is left recording, and every later call against its
     *       context fails too (`ID3D12CommandAllocator::Reset()` refuses an allocator whose list
     *       is still recording). Every decode and prefill submits on one process-wide command
     *       list, so for them this means every later submitting call in the process fails --
     *       terminal, independent of what `GetDeviceRemovedReason()` reports, since a stuck list
     *       is unusable whether or not the device itself is confirmed gone;
     *     - a fault raised AFTER submission (`ExecuteCommandLists` already queued the work; only
     *       the fence `Signal()` itself failed) is retried at a FRESH fence value minted for the
     *       retry, never the same value the failed call attempted -- a same-value retry cannot
     *       distinguish "the failed Signal() already advanced the fence" from "it did not," so it
     *       is not issued. If the retry `Signal()` itself fails, or the fence wait cannot be
     *       armed, this is ALSO a stranded submission and terminal: the buffers this call is about
     *       to release may still be in use by work the GPU has not finished, indistinguishable
     *       from here from a genuinely removed device, and `GetDeviceRemovedReason()` is what a
     *       caller must consult, exactly as the two cases above. Only when the retry `Signal()`
     *       succeeds and is waited out does the context genuinely recover on this path; a retry
     *       that recovers after the first `Signal()` failed with E_OUTOFMEMORY returns
     *       SSLM_GPU_ALLOCATION_FAILED instead.
     * (c) SslmGpuSeqPrefillSchemaContentForG5Bridge only: a device-side domain guard refused
     *     one of the admitted tokens, found by the post-chunk readback. The context and the
     *     device stay usable, but THE SEQUENCE DOES NOT, unlike cause (a): its live residual and
     *     layer index are not a resting state, and a decode call issued on it without a reset
     *     returns a token computed from that state. Call sslm_gpu_seq_reset before reusing the
     *     sequence. The prompt twin reports the same refusal as SSLM_SEQUENCE_REJECTED instead,
     *     with the same reset requirement (see that function's comment).
     * (d) 1.8.0: the process's submission device could not be set up, for a reason other than
     *     memory -- no D3D12 hardware adapter, device creation refused, or a D3D12 setup step
     *     failing with an HRESULT other than E_OUTOFMEMORY. Every call that submits GPU work
     *     returns this status, from every entry point, on every call, for the life of the
     *     process. A first-time setup that runs out of memory is not this cause: that call
     *     returns SSLM_GPU_ALLOCATION_FAILED, and the next call sets up again. */

 *  - an ordinary, healthy rejection when the chunk's own derived admit count comes back short
 *    of what was requested at a saturated context cap -- the context and device stay usable,
 *    and a caller may continue;
 *  - a real, contained non-allocation device fault from the GPU submit/finish tail, after which
 *    the command list is recovered and the context stays usable for a caller that continues,
 *    unless the device is confirmed removed or the submission is stranded, which is terminal;
 *  - a device-side domain guard refused one of the admitted tokens, found by the post-chunk
 *    readback. Tokens before the refused one are committed and `*consumed` counts them; the
 *    sequence's live residual and layer index are not a resting state, and the "ready for
 *    logits" flag may still be set from an earlier call, so a decode call issued without a reset
 *    returns a token computed from that state. The sequence must be reset before reuse;
 *  - (1.8.0) the process's submission device could not be set up, for a reason other than
 *    memory (the enum's cause (d)): nothing is submitted, `*consumed` is 0, and every later call
 *    that submits GPU work returns this status for the life of the process.
 * The status alone cannot say which cause applied, so a caller that cannot rule out the third
 * resets the sequence before issuing anything further on it. (The prompt twin reports the guard
 * refusal as SSLM_SEQUENCE_REJECTED instead.) */

 * out_capacity == 0 does NOT act as a prefill-independent size query: the no-snapshot check

 *     SSLM_SEQUENCE_KV_BUFFER_MISMATCH, nothing written.
 *  2. `seq` Submitted -> SSLM_BUSY, nothing written.
 *  3. No prefill snapshot -> SSLM_PREFILL_HIDDEN_UNAVAILABLE, nothing written. A fresh,
 *     restored or reset sequence holds none, and neither does one whose most recent prefill
 *     call that reached its admission pre-scan did not return SSLM_OK.
 *  4. `*out_required` = the hidden width, on this and every later outcome. `out_capacity`
 *     below it -> SSLM_OUTPUT_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, nothing else written.
 *  5. final_norm (the RmsNormSite call SslmGpuSeqFinishTokenForG5Bridge makes before logits)
 *     over the snapshot. A guard refusal -> SSLM_SEQUENCE_REJECTED, nothing written to
 *     `out_codes`, `out_scale_m` or `out_scale_e`.
 *  6. Writes exactly the hidden width of codes and the scale, returns SSLM_OK.
 *
 * Host-side: records no command list and adds no dispatch. Writes nothing on the sequence, so a
 * decode step issued after a read produces what it would have produced without it. `out_codes`
 * needs no alignment. Thread-safety as the rest of this header: calls on distinct sequences may
 * run concurrently; a read and another call driving the same sequence from two threads is a
 * caller error. */
