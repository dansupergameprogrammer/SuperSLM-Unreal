// which reproduces this function's PRE-B3 behavior byte-for-byte (the process-global
// g_resident_kv single-slot cache, unchanged). `external_kv_resident`, when non-null,
// is a caller-owned, ALREADY-ALLOCATED DEFAULT-heap UAV buffer (an SslmGpuSequenceHandle's
// own dedicated K/V residency, design Sec5.3) this call binds directly as kv_uav --
// bypassing g_resident_kv and its pointer/size fast-hit check entirely for this call, so
// two sequences each passing their OWN buffer here never share, alias, or evict each
// other's K/V state, closing this class for the K/V cache by construction
// (the same closure B2 already gave weight residency). `io_external_kv_needs_resume_barrier`
// is the caller-owned per-sequence latch this function reads/writes to track whether ITS
// buffer was left in COPY_SOURCE by the PRIOR call on this same handle (mirroring
// kv_fast_hit's own resume-barrier shape below, now scoped to one handle instead of one
// global slot): false on a sequence's first call (the buffer was created directly in
// UNORDERED_ACCESS state, design Sec5.3/Sec10 B3, no resume needed), set true at the end
// of every call that used this path (this call's own targeted readback always leaves the
// buffer in COPY_SOURCE), read (and consumed) at the top of the NEXT call on the same
// handle. `workspace`/`workspace_size` remain required in the external-buffer path too --
// still validated by this function's own existing size guard, and the targeted per-call
// readback still scatters into `workspace` exactly as it does today, so a caller in this
// mode gets the identical CPU-oracle-comparable host mirror the pre-existing path always
// produced (never merely a GPU self-consistency proof).
// (T-2577, D-SLM6278; T-2578 correction): the trailing `model_generation` parameter is the
// caller's own model identity for the read-only weight/RoPE caches and one conjunct of the
// mutable K/V cache key (`g_resident_weights`/`g_resident_kv`/`g_resident_rope`,
// `superslm_gpu.cpp`) -- an opaque value that MUST change whenever the model
// backing `layers`/`rope_tables`/`workspace` changes and MUST NOT change across sequences of the
// same still-live model (a per-load counter, or the artifact's own integrity hash reduced to 64
// bits, are both sound). Defaults to `0`, the "not supplied" sentinel: every pre-T-2577 caller
// compiles and behaves unchanged (`!fresh_sequence` alone gates the fast path, exactly as before
// this ticket). A caller that supplies a nonzero value gets the cheaper, identity-keyed path
// instead -- a fresh sequence of the SAME model is then a legitimate weight/RoPE cache hit,
// closing the ~19 ms/sequence cost the external review's Significant 1 measured
// (`Claude/Poirot/5fafd98-t2573-trackb-external-fold-review.md`) without reopening the recycled-
// host-address hazard T-2576 closed (a fresh sequence of a DIFFERENT model, even one that
// recycled the same address, still misses, because the identity does not match). K/V still
// requires `!fresh_sequence`: model identity cannot identify mutable sequence history.

// all -- this is what retires `g_resident_rope` for the handle-routed path: when `external_weights_resident` is non-null, `layers` is NEVER
// dereferenced (the caller's own resident buffer is bound directly, no re-pack, no
// re-upload, no g_resident_weights lookup); when BOTH `external_rope_cos_resident`/
// `external_rope_sin_resident` are non-null, `rope_tables` is never read for the two
// big tables (only `external_rope_has`/`external_rope_cos_elems`/
// `external_rope_sin_elems` decide the small per-call RopeInfo presence/size fields a
