// SuperSLM Layer-1 C ABI -- the production, engine-agnostic C surface for a CPU-side consumer:
// workspace and KV-pool sizing and lifetime, model and adapter mapping, sequence lifetime
// (create, save, restore, reset, release), prefix and prefill, schema-constrained decode,
// tokenization and detokenization, and stats.
//
// Every declaration in this header has `extern "C"` linkage and a stable ABI shape -- opaque
// handles, POD config/state structs, and a single closed `sslm_status` enum whose enumerator
// values never change once shipped. New functionality is added by appending new enumerators
// and new functions, never by renumbering or repurposing an existing one.
//
// Schema bind, rebind, and unbind are valid only on a newly created or successfully reset
// sequence. A generation call that passes argument validation makes the sequence ineligible until
// reset, including a valid no-op call or empty-prefix adoption. A call rejected for invalid
// arguments leaves the sequence untouched and still bindable. A restored sequence must be reset
// before schema binding.

 * design commit 4f4eb23896; symmetric-mirroring FOLD RULING on the third confirmation pass's F1,
 * design commit dated 2026-08-17).
 *
 * Prior to this fold this header declared only 19 of the 26 registry entries (ordinals 0-17 and
 * 25) -- G5's own schema block (18-24) existed only in tests/t2130-g5-red-suite/sslm_g5.h. F1
 * found the governance ruling's premise ("every one of the 26 entries is a shared name once
 * sslm_g5.h carries the complete list") false as written, because nothing had ever ruled the
 * symmetric obligation onto THIS header. The fold ruling corrects this: neither header owns a
 * subset of the registry to extend independently; both mirror the full, current, reconciled
 * enum verbatim, including the other side's block as enumerator VALUES this header's own C1-C7
 * build does not yet exercise functionally -- exactly the relationship sslm_g5.h already had to
 * SSLM_ALLOCATION_FAILED (25) before its own mirroring fold. Ordinal allocation stays Sec6's
 * alone; semantic ownership of G5's own schema-cause meanings (18-24) stays G5's --
 * only which header's enum body carries which NAMES changed.
 *
 * SSLM_STATUS_NEXT_FREE -- the enum's final member, auto-valued (no explicit numeric value:
 * the compiler assigns one past the current final real status, i.e. 29). This is the fold's OTHER
 * ruling: a plain #define "top" macro (SSLM_STATUS_BASE_MAX, retired this fold -- no design
 * record, no consumer beyond one test tool, F1 collateral) cannot move itself
 * when a header appends a new enumerator, so F1's four compiled mutations proved it silently
 * asserted nothing (Probe A: deleting the whole registry-top static_assert still compiled
 * clean). An auto-valued enum tag inside the enum body has no such gap -- it moves automatically
 * on whichever side appends, with nothing for an author to remember to hand-update. Gate C
 * (tools/t2139_gate_c_type_identity_check.cpp) asserts both headers' SSLM_STATUS_NEXT_FREE
 * equal, IN ADDITION TO (never replacing) its per-name checks: the per-name checks catch a
 * shared name claimed at different ordinals; the sentinel catches a shared ordinal claimed by
 * two different names (F1's Probe C, the collision the retired static_assert did not catch).
 *
 * The registry, complete (design Sec6 GOVERNANCE RULING table, verbatim ordinals) -- expressed
 * as an X-MACRO LIST rather than a hand-written enum body, per the fold ruling's own remedy #2:
 * "the per-name check list itself is generated from the header ... never hand-written, so a
 * newly appended enumerator cannot land without gaining a check line." SSLM_STATUS_ENUM_LIST is
 * that generation mechanism -- it is BOTH how this enum's own body is built (below) AND, by
 * design, the same list tools/t2139_gate_c_type_identity_check.cpp re-expands to emit one
 * T2139_GATE_C_STATUS_CHECK per name (see that file). A name added here without a matching Gate
 * C check is structurally impossible: there is no second place a name could be added to this
 * enum, and any TU that expands SSLM_STATUS_ENUM_LIST sees every name this one does. */
